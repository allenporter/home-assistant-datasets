The homes for this\ndataset were synthetically generated using gpt-3.5, and then simplified for\nexercising smaller LLMs.\n\nThis is a variation on the `assist` dataset that tests far fewer entities, devices,\nand areas at once. This is designed given poor performance of local models on the\n`assist` baseline to help with even smaller tasks to focus on to improve quailty.\n\nThe use cases are not intended to be very tricky or complicated and aimed at a\nsmaller context window. The number of devices/entities in each test is intentionally\nsmall (e.g. typically under 5 entities per test) to focus on tool calling capabilities\nrather than context retrieval.\n\nThis dataset uses the `assist` format. See the `assist` dataset card and README for\nadditional details about the format and information about running the evaluation.', urls=['https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/datasets/assist', 'https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/datasets/assist-mini'], count=4, version='v1', path='datasets/assist-mini', config_entry_data=None, config_entry_options=None),

This dataset is in development and contains\njust a few initial examples. Each benchmark creates a synthetic home fixture\nand configures the entities with a particular state, then asks for an automation\nfor a specific set of devices.\n\nThe benchmark loads a synthetic home and runs pytest with Home Assistant to\nrun through scenarios that should trigger the automation. It also gives points\nfor getting inputs correct and each problem benchmark exercises different\nscenarios that add to the overall score. The various scenarios are not weighted.', urls=['https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/datasets/automations'], count=None, version='v0', path='datasets/automations', config_entry_data=None, config_entry_options={'llm_hass_api': '', 'max_tokens': 4096}),
    DatasetCard(name='intents', description='A dataset built form the Home Assistant intents repo, modeled after existing\nNLP test cases for the assistant pipeline.\n\nThis dataset has been adapted for evaluating the Home Assistant LLM API ([blog post](https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/05/20/llm-api/))\nimported from the home assistant intents repo.\n\nThis is mean to reuse the tests that already exist for the NLP, which turns out\nto expose some weaknesses or differences of interpretation of tasks. It also is\na very large home which is challenging for smaller models given the ~100 or so\ndevices. Lastly, there are some tests that have subtle mismatches that are reasonable (e.g.\n"minimum brightness" tests)\n\nThis dataset uses the `assist` format.
