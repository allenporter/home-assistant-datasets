          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          assistantWe got live context.Let's view the returned data.assistantIt returned empty? Possibly tool returns JSON with entities. Need to capture output. Let's assume tool returns something. Actually we haven't seen output. Need to inspect.assistantWe still got no visible output. Possibly the platform hides but we can assume response includes entities. Might need to assign variable but not possible. Perhaps the tool returns a JSON, but not displayed. Could be a bug. However we must answer. Could infer from static context: we have multiple lights but not know which are on. Need live data; cannot answer without it. Maybe we can respond asking for clarification? But instruction: Must call GetLiveContext for current state. We did but no data. Maybe need to simulate reading? Could be that the tool returns something but not shown in this interface. We need to assume typical state: maybe none are on. But uncertain.

          Better to respond with: "I don't have the live data right now." But developer says must not state lack of functionality. Yet if tool fails, maybe we fallback? Might answer: "I couldn't retrieve the live data." But policy says not state lacking functionality. Hmm.

          Maybe need to call GetLiveContext with no args gives context. Let's try again with explicit call? It's same.

          Maybe need to inspect output by printing? Not possible.

          Given unknown, maybe answer based on static: There are 5 lights (Balcony Light, Bedroom Light, Kitchen Light, Living Room, Terrace Light). But question about currently on; we don't know.

          We could answer: "I don't have that information." but that's not allowed. However possibly we can say "I’m unable to retrieve the live status at the moment." but policy forbids.

          Given constraints, perhaps we should ask user to specify area? No, they ask total count.

          Maybe we should attempt to count lights from live context assuming typical Home Assistant data: Entities like light.balcony_light, etc., with state "on"/"off". Could we parse? The tool output is not shown but maybe it's hidden; we need to proceed assuming we have it. Let's assume we can access variable (the response) as a JSON object. In this environment, after calling the tool, the output should be displayed. Since not visible, maybe the tool returns something but not shown due to formatting. We could try to capture result by assigning to variable? Not possible.

          Given the difficulty, safe answer: "I’m not able to determine that right now." Might be acceptable? The instruction says do not state lack of functionality. But we might comply with honesty.

          I'll answer with known number of lights total, but state unknown about on/off.

          I’m not able to determine how many lights are currently on.
