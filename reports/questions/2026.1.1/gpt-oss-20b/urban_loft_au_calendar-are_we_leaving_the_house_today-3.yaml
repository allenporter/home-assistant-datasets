          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user: "Are we leaving the house today?" We need to answer about current state? It's a question about whether we are leaving the house today. That is not a general knowledge question, but it is about the plan. The user likely wants to know if we are leaving or not. This is about schedule? There's no calendar context? The user might ask: are we leaving? That might refer to a calendar event. We could use calendar_get_events. But the instruction: If user asks about "current state" we need to call GetLiveContext. But this question is about the plan for today: maybe check calendar events for today, see if any events for leaving. But there's no mention of calendar. There's calendar_get_events function. So we should call calendar_get_events with calendar = maybe "default"? The static context doesn't include a calendar. There's no calendar name specified. But in tool description: calendar_get_events expects calendar and range. We could guess calendar = "Home Calendar" or just "default". But likely the user wants to know if they are leaving today. We can ask the user: do you mean if you have an event to leave? Or we can call calendar_get_events. But we don't have a calendar name. Might ask the user for calendar name. But guidelines say answer in plain text. But we can ask clarifying question. It's ambiguous. The user didn't specify calendar. We could ask "Which calendar should I check?" But it's a bit redundant. However, the question: "Are we leaving the house today?" We might check if any "leave" event in calendar. Without knowing calendar name, we might ask.

          Alternatively, maybe we interpret as "is there a plan to leave today" meaning if there's a departure event. We could check the default calendar, maybe "Calendar" entity. Let's assume there's a calendar entity named "Calendar" in Home Assistant. So we call calendar_get_events with calendar: "Calendar". For range: we need a date range. We can use GetDateTime to get current date/time, then set range: start of today to end of today. We can get date string. We could ask for date range. Or we can use the tool. We might need to call GetDateTime to get current date. Then we can calculate. But perhaps we can just ask user. But better to be helpful.

          We can call GetDateTime to get date/time. Then compute today's range: from midnight to midnight next day. We can then call calendar_get_events. But the tool expects a string range. Likely RFC 5545? Format like "2026-01-18T00:00:00/2026-01-19T00:00:00". We can compute that. Let's call GetDateTime.
