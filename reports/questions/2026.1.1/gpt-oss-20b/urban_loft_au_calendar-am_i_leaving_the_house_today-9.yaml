          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        content: I’m not sure which calendar you’d like me to check. Could you let
          me know which calendar contains your schedule?
        thinking_content: 'User asks about leaving the house. This is a current state
          question? It might involve calendar events. It''s about user leaving the
          house, likely requires checking calendar. They ask "Am I leaving the house
          today?" That requires querying calendar events for today to see if they
          have any event leaving? Actually it is about the user leaving the house:
          might check calendar or maybe check if they have any event scheduled to
          leave. Likely need to query calendar for events today. We''ll use calendar_get_events
          with range today. Also might ask getLiveContext? It''s not about device
          state but about schedule. So call calendar_get_events with calendar "Tasks"?
          Wait the calendar might be named "Tasks" or maybe "Calendar" not specified.
          The static context doesn''t list calendar. There''s a todo list but not
          calendar. We can use calendar_get_events: calendar: "Events" or maybe "Calendar"?
          The instructions say use calendar_get_events to get events. We need to specify
          the calendar name: maybe "Home Calendar"? Not known. The user didn''t specify.
          We can ask for clarification? But the user asked "Am I leaving the house
          today?" We can interpret that as checking if any events today. But we don''t
          know which calendar. We could ask for clarification: "Which calendar would
          you like me to check?" But user didn''t ask. We can assume default calendar
          "Tasks"? But that''s a todo list, not a calendar. Maybe we ask: "Which calendar
          do you want me to check?" This is ambiguous. According to instructions:
          "Get events from a calendar. When asked if something happens, search the
          whole week." So we need to call calendar_get_events with calendar name and
          range. The user didn''t specify a calendar. We might ask for clarification.
          But maybe we can assume "Events" or "Calendar". Better to ask: "Which calendar
          should I check?" So let''s ask for clarification.'
