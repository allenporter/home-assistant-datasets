          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          We need to check calendar events. The user asks "According to my calendar, is anyone visiting?" That requires fetching calendar events for the week. Use calendar_get_events. We need calendar name. We have a static context only with device list. But calendar name is not given. The user says "According to my calendar". Usually we assume "Calendar" or default calendar. Maybe the user uses "Calendar" as calendar name. We can ask for calendar name? The instruction says: "Get events from a calendar. When asked if something happens, search the whole week." So we should call calendar_get_events with calendar: "Calendar" or maybe "Home Calendar"? But not specified. Could ask user. But we can assume default calendar "Home". But better to ask user. But the instructions: When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. For calendar, the tool calendar_get_events requires calendar and range. The user didn't specify calendar. Might default to some calendar name. We could ask user for the calendar name. But the question is "According to my calendar, is anyone visiting?" We can assume the user wants to know if any events with 'visiting' or any events? Maybe check events for this week. Could ask calendar name. Let's ask: "Which calendar would you like me to check?" Then we can call. But we can also guess "Calendar". But better to ask. The instruction doesn't forbid asking clarifying question. So we ask.

          We should use tool to get events. But need calendar name. Ask user.
