          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: |-
          User: "Who am I meeting for dinner?" We need to answer. This is not a question about home devices. It's a personal knowledge question. The assistant should answer from internal knowledge. There's no mention of any calendar or personal data. The user is asking "Who am I meeting for dinner?" We cannot answer unless we have calendar data. But the user didn't specify a time. The system instructions say: if the user asks about a calendar event: use calendar_get_events. But the user didn't specify a date/time. Perhaps we interpret they want next upcoming dinner? The user is asking who they are meeting for dinner, probably next upcoming dinner. We need to query the calendar for events in the week? The instructions: "Get events from a calendar. When asked if something happens, search the whole week." So we should call calendar_get_events for the user's calendar for the week range. The calendar name presumably "Tasks"? Wait static context: "names: Tasks domain: todo". There's no calendar named. But the tool: calendar_get_events takes a calendar string. The user didn't specify. We can guess it's "Events" or "Calendar". We don't have a calendar name. The user didn't specify a calendar. We may need to ask for clarification. But instructions: "When asked if something happens, search the whole week." That suggests we should query the calendar. But we need a calendar name. We could assume "Home Assistant" or "Calendar". Might need to ask. Let's follow instructions: If user asks about an event, we need to search the whole week. But we don't know the calendar. We can ask: "Which calendar should I check?" But maybe there's a default calendar. The static context didn't include a calendar. But the user is likely to have a calendar. We'll ask: "Which calendar should I check for dinner events?" But the instruction says: "When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type." That is unrelated.

          Thus answer: "I'm not sure. Which calendar?" But we could provide a generic answer: "I don't have that info." But the system says we should not state lack of functionality if the question requires live data. We must use GetLiveContext? No, that is for live state. This is about schedule. Use calendar_get_events. We need to supply "calendar" and "range". Range is whole week. We can set range: "2026-01-18 to 2026-01-25". But we don't know current date? We have GetDateTime. We can call GetDateTime to get current date. Then construct range. Let's do that: call GetDateTime. Then call calendar_get_events with calendar "Calendar" or "Events". But we don't know calendar name. Maybe default is "Events". But we can call with "Calendar" which might be default.

          Better: Ask clarifying question: "Which calendar would you like me to check?" Let's follow user request. They want to know who they're meeting for dinner. We need calendar data. So ask: "Which calendar would you like me to check?" That is simpler. Let's do that.
