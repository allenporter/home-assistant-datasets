          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user asks: "How many nights this week do I need to cook?" We need to interpret. They might refer to a task list or cooking tasks. We need to see the todo list or any scheduled events. The static context doesn't include tasks. We can use todo_get_items to query. Likely there is a todo list "Tasks" that contains items maybe like "Cook dinner" with due dates. So we need to call todo_get_items with status "needs_action" maybe. But also we need to filter by due dates? The function todo_get_items has parameters: status, todo_list. There's no date filter. But we can retrieve the items and parse? The question: "How many nights this week do I need to cook?" Probably ask the user for number of nights. We need to check the todo list. We'll call todo_get_items with status "needs_action" and todo_list "Tasks". Then analyze items due this week. But function does not support date filtering; we can just return items and we might interpret due dates manually. But better to ask user: maybe the system has tasks with due dates. We need to call todo_get_items. But we need to specify status: likely "needs_action". There's no other parameter. So we call. Then we need to interpret. But we cannot parse due dates in the response? The function returns items, but we need to interpret. We could provide the answer: count items with due dates this week. But we need to ask the user if they want to check. Could ask them to clarify. But the user is asking. We can answer by looking at the to-do list. Let's call todo_get_items.

          We need to provide output with the function call.
