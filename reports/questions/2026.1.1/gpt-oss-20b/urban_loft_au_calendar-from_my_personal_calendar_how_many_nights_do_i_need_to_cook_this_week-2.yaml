          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user asks: "From my personal calendar, how many nights do I need to cook this week?" We need to get calendar events from a calendar. The tool `calendar_get_events` takes calendar and range. We need to determine calendar name. It's "personal calendar". Let's assume calendar name is "personal". We need to search the whole week. Use range "week". But we need a date range. The tool probably expects something like "2026-01-18 to 2026-01-25" or similar. We can use "week" or use today's date and 7 days. Let's assume we can use a standard range. The tool expects a string. Probably "next week" or "week". We'll provide a range: maybe "2026-01-18/2026-01-25". Let's ask tool.

          We call `calendar_get_events` with calendar: "personal" and range: "2026-01-18/2026-01-25". The response will include events. Then we need to count how many nights (i.e., events that involve cooking). The user likely wants count of nights where they need to cook. The events may have titles like "Dinner" or "Cook". The tool might return events in RFC 5545 format. We need to parse the events to count nights. The assistant should process the tool's output. We need to call the tool first.

          The tool expects calendar names to be from a predefined list. The static context only lists devices, not calendars. Possibly the tool only supports a calendar named "Personal". So we should use "Personal" capitalized. The error indicates dictionary value must be one of ['Personal'].

          So we call with calendar: "Personal". Let's do that.

          not be the current week. However, the tool returned events for the week.
          Probably the user wants to know number of nights scheduled to cook. Based
          on the events, 3 nights. The event "Cynthia''s Birthday" is not a cooking
          event. So answer: 3 nights. Use plain text.'
