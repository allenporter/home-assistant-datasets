          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          User asks: "Are we leaving the house today?" This is a question about current state or planned state? It might refer to user's travel or leaving. Not about a device. This is not a question about the home. It's a general knowledge or user question about their schedule? There's no tool to check calendar? There's calendar_get_events. Could answer using that. Use calendar_get_events to check events for the user today. But the question is ambiguous: "Are we leaving the house today?" We should check the calendar for events that indicate leaving. But maybe the user means "Are we leaving the house today?" They might be referencing the calendar for their schedule. We should call calendar_get_events for the whole week? They said for queries about events: "Get events from a calendar. When asked if something happens, search the whole week. Results are RFC 5545." So for this we should call calendar_get_events for the user's calendar "Calendar" for range "2024-01-18" to "2024-01-25"? Wait it's January 18, 2026. We need current date. GetDateTime will provide date. But we can call calendar_get_events with range. The range format likely expects RFC 5545 date-time? It didn't specify format. Usually calendar_get_events expects a string range "2024-01-18T00:00:00Z/2024-01-25T00:00:00Z". We can use GetDateTime to get now. Then calculate a week ahead. Let's call GetDateTime to get current date. Then call calendar_get_events with the appropriate range. Use calendar name "Calendar"? The function requires "calendar" argument. We have static context no calendar names. We have "Weather Service". But calendar may not be defined. But the user may refer to "Calendar" default. We need to guess. Use "Calendar" as calendar. So call calendar_get_events with calendar: "Calendar", range: e.g., "2026-01-18T00:00:00/2026-01-25T00:00:00". We need date. Use GetDateTime. But we don't have date string. We can just call calendar_get_events with "Calendar" and "2026-01-18T00:00:00/2026-01-25T00:00:00". That likely works. The result will be RFC 5545. But we can parse. The assistant can answer: "Yes, you have an event at [time]" or "No, you have no events." So need to parse the output. Since we don't have actual data, we can just call calendar_get_events. Then provide answer.

          Given we can't parse RFC 5545 easily, we can approximate. Let's call calendar_get_events.
