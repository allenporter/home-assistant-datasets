          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user asks: "According to my personal calendar, do I have any events away from home today?" We need to check events from personal calendar. We have the tool `calendar_get_events` that requires `calendar` and `range`. We need to search the week. The user wants to know if they have any events away from home today. We need to query calendar for events. We need to use `calendar_get_events`. The static context doesn't mention calendars. So we should call the tool.

          We must call `calendar_get_events` with appropriate calendar name and range. Probably the user has a personal calendar named "Personal Calendar". We can use that. Range: we should provide today's date to end of today? For events away from home, we might need to check location? The events might have location details. But the calendar tool returns RFC 5545. We can search entire week. So we set range: today to end of day. We can just do a generic range like "2026-01-18/2026-01-19" (from start of today to end of day). But we don't have current date; we can call `GetDateTime` to get date.

          Let's call `GetDateTime` first to get date. Then call `calendar_get_events` with calendar: "Personal Calendar" and range: from start of today to end of today. But the tool expects a string. So we need to format a date range. Use something like "2026-01-18T00:00:00/2026-01-18T23:59:59".

          Thus we should first call GetDateTime. Then call calendar_get_events. Then parse the returned events for any that have location not "Home" or not same location. But we might not parse fully; we just need to answer: do I have any events away from home today? We can say yes/no and maybe list them.

          So the assistant will call GetDateTime. Then calendar_get_events. Then provide answer.

          We must not mention the tool. We should respond once we get results. We need to call GetLiveContext? Actually we need calendar data. We must use calendar_get_events.

          We will produce calls accordingly.
