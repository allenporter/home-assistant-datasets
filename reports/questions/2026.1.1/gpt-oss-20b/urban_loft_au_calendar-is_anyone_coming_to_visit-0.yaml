          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        content: Which calendar would you like me to check for scheduled visitors?
        thinking_content: 'User asks: "Is anyone coming to visit?" This is a question
          about scheduled visitors. We need to check the calendar? The user hasn''t
          specified calendar. We might need to get events from calendar. Possibly
          use calendar_get_events. We should specify calendar and range. Probably
          ask user which calendar or just default? According to instructions: get
          events from a calendar. There''s no calendar specified. The user likely
          has a default calendar called maybe "Calendar". In static context, there''s
          a Weather Service, but not a calendar. There''s a todo list. The user might
          want to know if someone has scheduled visits. We can use calendar_get_events
          with a default calendar name? But we need a calendar argument. Might ask
          user to specify which calendar. But the user didn''t specify. But we might
          assume a calendar named "Calendar" or "Home Calendar". But it''s safer to
          ask for clarification? The instructions didn''t say to ask for clarification.
          We can attempt to use calendar_get_events with a likely calendar. But we
          don''t know the name. There might be a calendar entity. We can look at GetLiveContext
          maybe provides information. But the question is not about device state.
          It''s about scheduled visits. We could call calendar_get_events with a calendar
          name. If we don''t know name, maybe "Home Calendar"? But we don''t have
          a name. Let''s assume "Calendar" and ask range "this week". Or we can ask
          for clarification: "Which calendar would you like me to check?" But instructions:
          "When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to
          specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type." That doesn''t
          apply. So we can either assume or ask. I''d ask for clarification. But we
          can also respond with "I don''t have a calendar set up." But maybe there''s
          a default calendar entity. The tool requires a calendar name string. The
          user didn''t provide. So we should ask: "Which calendar would you like me
          to check?" Let''s ask.'
