          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'User asks: "According to my personal calendar, are we leaving
          the house today?" We need to check calendar events for the week. Use calendar_get_events.
          Need to supply calendar name and range. We assume "personal calendar". They
          didn''t specify calendar name. In static context we don''t have calendar
          names; we have only weather service and so on. But we have function calendar_get_events
          that expects calendar: string. We might need to guess the calendar name.
          But we can ask clarification. But per instructions: "If user asks about
          device existence/type, answer from static context." For calendar, we need
          to use the function. We can ask for calendar name? But user said "my personal
          calendar". We can assume calendar name is "Personal". But to be safe, maybe
          ask them to confirm. But user didn''t provide calendar. We can attempt to
          query "Personal" or "personal". I''d guess it''s "Personal". Let''s attempt:
          calendar_get_events with calendar: "Personal" and range: "2026-01-18/2026-01-25"
          (one week). Or maybe "today" we just need events today. But we should provide
          range covering today. The function expects range string. Let''s pass "2026-01-18/2026-01-25"
          as a week. Use date. Let''s get current date: "2026-01-18". We need to call
          GetDateTime? Not necessary, we can assume date. But safe: We can just call
          calendar_get_events with "Personal" and "2026-01-18/2026-01-25". Use function.'
