          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          User asks: "According to my personal calendar, are we leaving the house today?" We need to check calendar events. We have a tool calendar_get_events. Provide calendar name: "personal calendar" or maybe "calendar" in context. We need to fetch events for the week or today. The instruction: When asked if something happens, search the whole week. So we need to call calendar_get_events with calendar: "personal calendar" or maybe "Personal Calendar". The static context does not give calendar name. But we can guess "personal calendar" is likely the name. So call calendar_get_events with calendar: "personal calendar" and range: "now/now+1week" or something. The instructions: "search the whole week" - so maybe range: "now/now+7d" but function signature: range: string. We can pass "this week" or "next 7 days". Probably "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z/2023-01-08T00:00:00Z" but we don't know. Let's pass "now-1w/now+1w" maybe. The function doesn't specify format. But maybe "today" is enough. The user: "are we leaving the house today?" We check events that involve leaving the house? We need to look for event titles like "Leaving house" or maybe any event scheduled today? The question: Are we leaving the house today? If there's an event that indicates leaving the house, maybe an event "Leave for work" etc. We can't deduce. We need to call the calendar_get_events with range: "now/now+1d" maybe. But the instruction says search whole week. So we could use range: "now/now+1w". The tool will respond with events. Then we answer. We must use the tool's response. So we call calendar_get_events.

          Let's call: calendar_get_events(calendar: "Personal Calendar", range: "now/now+7d"). We'll see.
