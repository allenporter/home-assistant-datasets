          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user asks: "According to my personal calendar, are we leaving the house today?" We need to answer about calendar events. There's a tool `calendar_get_events`. We need to check events. The user wants to know if they are leaving the house today. We need to search personal calendar for the whole week? The instruction says: For calendar events, search the whole week. They are asking "are we leaving the house today?" So we need to query the calendar. Use `calendar_get_events` with calendar: probably "personal calendar". But we need to know the calendar name. The static context doesn't include calendar names. But from the instruction: `calendar_get_events` requires calendar and range. We can use "personal" or "personal calendar". Let's assume "personal". Range should be today's date? The instruction: "search the whole week." So we could pass range of this week. Use date range: from today to Sunday. But we need date format. We can call GetDateTime to get current date and time. We can calculate range. But simpler: Use the tool with range "2026-01-18/2026-01-25" maybe. Let's call GetDateTime to get date. Then use that date to compute start and end. Use python-like. We can't do actual date calculations here. But we can approximate: Today Jan 18 2026. Next Sunday Jan 22 2026. So range "2026-01-18/2026-01-23". Let's call the tool. Then interpret the output. We don't know the output. We assume the tool returns events. We need to check if there is an event about leaving the house today. We can't know. Maybe we should ask if they have an event titled "Leave house" or something. But we can ask the tool. Use `calendar_get_events(calendar: "personal", range: "2026-01-18/2026-01-23")`. Then parse. But the user question: "are we leaving the house today?" Might be a yes/no question. We could respond: "Yes, you have an event scheduled to leave the house at 10:00 AM." if event exists. But we don't know. The safe answer: "I'm checking your calendar..." Then call tool. Then respond. The assistant should call the tool, wait for response. Then give answer.

          We'll call the function.
