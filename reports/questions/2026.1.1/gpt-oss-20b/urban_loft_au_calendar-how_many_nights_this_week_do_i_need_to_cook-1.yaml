          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'User: "How many nights this week do I need to cook?" This
          is a question about the user''s schedule: nights this week cooking. We need
          to know what their schedule or meal plan is. Possibly we can query todo
          list for tasks "cook" or "meal" or check calendar. We can ask GetDateTime?
          Actually they ask for "how many nights this week do I need to cook?" This
          likely requires reading their calendar or todo list. We need to get events
          from calendar. Use calendar_get_events. They ask "this week". We can get
          range of this week. We can specify calendar: maybe "Tasks"? Actually tasks
          are a todo list. But to check scheduled cooking, maybe use "Tasks" todo
          list. The user didn''t specify a specific calendar. We can ask them to clarify?
          However we might attempt to interpret: user likely has events on their calendar
          for cooking nights. Let''s call calendar_get_events with calendar maybe
          "default" or "Calendar"? We don''t have calendar names in static context.
          We can guess "Calendar" or "Personal". But no mention. There''s "Weather
          Service" domain weather. No calendars listed. We can ask them to specify
          which calendar. But they didn''t. They want nights this week they need to
          cook. We could infer from their todo list: maybe they have tasks like "Cook
          dinner" with due dates. We can use todo_get_items with status "needs_action"
          or "all" and list tasks containing cooking. But no guarantee. Probably we
          should ask for clarification: Which calendar or schedule? But instructions
          say answer truthfully. The assistant should attempt to use available tools.
          We can call todo_get_items to get all incomplete tasks in "Tasks". Then
          filter in code for tasks containing "cook" or "meal". But we need to do
          that programmatically. We can get items. Let''s call todo_get_items with
          todo_list "Tasks" and status "needs_action". That returns tasks. Then count
          those that are scheduled for nights this week? The tasks may not have dates.
          Without date info can''t decide. Maybe better to ask the user to clarify
          which calendar. But the user just asked. Perhaps we can interpret that they
          have a calendar of cooking schedule. The assistant can ask "Which calendar
          would you like me to check?" but that might break the instruction to keep
          it simple. But we can answer "I don''t have that information." But the instruction
          says we cannot state lacking functionality. We must answer. Maybe we can
          ask them to provide calendar. But not ideal. Could ask "Could you clarify
          which calendar to check?" But user might want answer. Perhaps we can try
          to fetch from todo list. Let''s attempt to call todo_get_items. Then we
          can parse tasks containing "cook" or "dinner" and count them. Let''s do
          that.'
