          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user asks: "Do I have any personal calendar events away from home today?" We need to answer whether the user has any personal calendar events that are away from home today. We need to search the calendar. The static context lists "calendar" names? Not in static context. We need to call the tool calendar_get_events. We need to specify which calendar? The user says "personal calendar events". There's no mention of a specific calendar name. We can assume "personal" calendar. Maybe there's a default calendar name like "Personal". But we don't know the name. The tool requires calendar string and range string. We can call with "personal" and today's date range. We can find date via GetDateTime. Let's use GetDateTime to get current date and time. Then call calendar_get_events with range from start of day to end of day. Use calendar "personal" or maybe "Personal Calendar". The question: "Do i have any personal calendar events away from home today?" So we need to check if any events with location not at home. Let's just call calendar_get_events for "personal" calendar for the entire day. Then parse the result: RFC 5545 format, check each event's location field. If any event where location not "Home" or similar, then answer yes. But we cannot parse RFC 5545 within ChatGPT. But we can simply call the tool. The tool might return events with details. We need to output answer. We'll call the tool.

          We also need to pass range: something like "2026-01-18T00:00:00Z/2026-01-18T23:59:59Z". We need to get current date from GetDateTime.

          Thus call GetDateTime. Then use that to format. Then call calendar_get_events. We'll output the answer after receiving events. We'll just parse if any events where location not at home. But maybe we don't parse fully, but we can answer based on presence of location field. Let's assume the tool returns a list of events. We can inspect manually after tool returns. But as ChatGPT, we can't parse JSON. But we can just assume the result and respond accordingly. But we should ask tool. We'll call GetDateTime first.

          or mode of devices, sensors, entities, or areas. Use this tool for: 1. Answering
          questions about current conditions (e.g., ''Is the light on?''). 2. As the
          first step in conditional actions (e.g., ''If the weather is rainy, turn
          off sprinklers'' requires checking the weather first).'
