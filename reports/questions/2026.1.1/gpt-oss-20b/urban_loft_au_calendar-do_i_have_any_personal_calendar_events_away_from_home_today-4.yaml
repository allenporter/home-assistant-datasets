          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          User asks about personal calendar events away from home today. We need to get events from a calendar. There's a tool: calendar_get_events. The static context didn't mention a calendar name. Possibly "personal calendar" is an entity name. We need to query calendar_get_events with calendar name "personal calendar" maybe. Also need to specify range: today? The user says away from home today. They might want events that occur outside home? We can't infer location, just date. Let's just get events for today. Use calendar_get_events with calendar: "personal calendar", range: "today". Or maybe use "current week"? The instruction says: "When asked if something happens, search the whole week. Results are RFC 5545 which means 'end' is exclusive." So we should search whole week. We'll call calendar_get_events with range "this week". Use calendar "personal calendar". But we need to provide name? The tool expects "calendar" param. Let's do that. Then interpret events.

          We don't know the result format, but likely a list of events with start/end. We'll parse. Use GetLiveContext? No, this is calendar data, not live state. We'll call calendar_get_events. Then answer: "Yes, you have X event at time." If none, say none.
