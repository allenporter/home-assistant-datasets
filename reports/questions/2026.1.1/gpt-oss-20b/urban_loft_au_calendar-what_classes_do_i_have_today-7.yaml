          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user asks: "What classes do I have today?" This seems like a personal calendar query. We can use the calendar_get_events function. The user presumably wants events for today. We need to specify calendar name and range. The static context does not include calendars, but we can still call calendar_get_events. There's no name of calendar given. The typical calendar name might be "Calendar" or "Personal Calendar". But we don't know the exact calendar. We might ask the user. However, we could guess to use "Calendar". But the instructions didn't say to guess. Usually we should ask for clarification if uncertain. But maybe we can call calendar_get_events with calendar: "Calendar" and range: "today". Range probably expects a date range. We can pass "2026-01-18T00:00:00/2026-01-19T00:00:00" or just "today". The instructions: "Get events from a calendar. When asked if something happens, search the whole week. Results are RFC 5545." The user didn't specify a calendar, but we can assume default "Calendar". But safer to ask. But the user just asks "What classes do I have today?" We could answer by calling the calendar_get_events function with "Calendar" and "today". But the function expects a range. We need a string. Could be "2026-01-18/2026-01-19". Let's construct. But maybe the user expects the assistant to find events. We could do that. We don't have knowledge of the calendar. We'll call the function.

          Let's call calendar_get_events with calendar: "Calendar" and range: "2026-01-18/2026-01-19". We'll then respond accordingly based on results. So we need to call the function.
