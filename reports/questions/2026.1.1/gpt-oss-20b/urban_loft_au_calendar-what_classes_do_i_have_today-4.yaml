          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          User asks: "What classes do I have today?" This is a question about calendar events. We have the tool calendar_get_events. They want classes they have today. So we call calendar_get_events with calendar likely "Calendar" maybe? We don't have name but we can guess "Calendar" or maybe "calendar" param. We need to supply a range: the whole week. "When asked if something happens, search the whole week." So we need to call with calendar: something like "Calendar" but we don't have explicit name. We'll try "calendar" maybe "Calendar"? We'll call with range: "2026-01-18 00:00:00" to "2026-01-25 00:00:00"? But we don't have date. Use GetDateTime to get current date/time. Let's call GetDateTime to get now, then compute start and end of week. But we might just pass the date range as "2026-01-18T00:00:00Z to 2026-01-25T00:00:00Z". However, we don't have exact date. But we can do with GetDateTime to get now. We'll call GetDateTime first. Then compute range. But we can't do calculation here. Let's approximate range: "2026-01-18" to "2026-01-25". We'll call calendar_get_events with calendar: "Calendar" and range "2026-01-18T00:00:00Z/2026-01-25T00:00:00Z". That will return events. Then we will filter those that are classes? We just output whatever events.

          But maybe the user wants classes scheduled today. So we need to get events for today. We'll set range to "2026-01-18T00:00:00Z/2026-01-19T00:00:00Z". Let's do that. So first call GetDateTime? But maybe not needed. I'll use calendar_get_events with range for today. The tool will give events.

          Thus, produce: call calendar_get_events.
