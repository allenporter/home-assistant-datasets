          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        content: Which calendar would you like me to check for visits?
        thinking_content: |-
          User asks: "According to my calendar, is anyone visiting?" We need to check events from the calendar. Likely we need to call calendar_get_events. Need to ask for range: entire week? The instruction says: "When asked if something happens, search the whole week. Results are RFC 5545 which means 'end' is exclusive." So we call calendar_get_events with calendar: "Tasks"?? Wait static context: There is a todo list called "Tasks". But calendar likely refers to some calendar. We need to know which calendar. The static context doesn't list a calendar, but the function is calendar_get_events. We need to provide calendar name string and range. We don't know the calendar name. The user said "my calendar". Likely the calendar is named "Tasks"? Or there might be a calendar named "Events" or "Personal". Without knowledge, we might ask the user. But instruction: "When asked if something happens, search the whole week." So we should search the whole week. But we need calendar name. Could ask user to specify calendar? We could assume default calendar name "Events". But better ask: "Which calendar?" However we can try to use default "Tasks" as calendar. But it's a todo list, not calendar. Might not have events. There's also a weather service. I think better to ask which calendar. But the question: "According to my calendar, is anyone visiting?" This is a query about schedule. We could respond: "Let me check your calendar for the week." But we need calendar name. In many HA setups, the calendar integration might be called "Google Calendar" or "calendar". We might need to ask. But maybe we can call calendar_get_events with calendar: "Events" and range: "2026-01-18T00:00:00Z/2026-01-25T00:00:00Z" (one week). But we can't guess.

          We should ask clarifying question: "Which calendar would you like me to check?" That seems appropriate.

          Thus: respond asking which calendar.
