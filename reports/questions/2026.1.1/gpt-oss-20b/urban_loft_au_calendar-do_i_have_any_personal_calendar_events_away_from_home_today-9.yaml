          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user asks: "Do i have any personal calendar events away from home today?" This is about calendar events. We should call calendar_get_events tool with calendar parameter "personal"? But we need to know the calendar name. They ask for "personal calendar events away from home today." We need to interpret: likely they have a calendar named "Personal". In static context we don't have a calendar name. The instruction: There's a tool: calendar_get_events with parameters calendar and range. We need to pass the calendar name. The user says "personal calendar events". So we can use calendar="Personal" or "Personal Calendar" or "personal". Let's assume the calendar is called "Personal". The range: we need to search the whole week. But they specifically ask "away from home today". So we need to filter events that are not at home. But we don't have location info. The tool may provide RFC 5545 events. We need to call the tool to get events for this week, then filter for location away from home. The question: "Do i have any personal calendar events away from home today?" It's a yes/no question. We need to check events. So call calendar_get_events with calendar="Personal" and range="2026-01-18/2026-01-25" maybe. The user only cares about today. We can set range to today's date. But the tool says search the whole week. So we should pass a range covering the whole week. For date/time, we may call GetDateTime to get today. Let's call GetDateTime to get the date. Then format the range. But we might just use a fixed range. But better to call GetDateTime. Then call calendar_get_events. Then parse events. But we don't have to show tool calls in final. We must call them. We'll first get current date: call GetDateTime. Then parse? In assistant we can't parse? We can call GetDateTime. But we can't parse its output? We can use tool. Let's do first GetDateTime. Then use that date to build range. But we might just pass range as "2026-01-18/2026-01-25". That covers the week. Use calendar="Personal". We'll call the tool.

          We need to respond: "Do i have any personal calendar events away from home today?" We need to answer yes/no. So we need to inspect events. The tool will return events. We can't see them? But we need to reason about them. Let's call calendar_get_events. Then we must parse the events. We don't have to output the tool call. We'll produce an answer. We'll do the tool call.

          We got two events. The user: "Do i have any personal calendar events away from home today?" We need to check if there are events today (2026-01-18?). Wait, the calendar returned events in 2025-04-02. This is likely wrong because the date is far. But it's the only events. Since it's not today, we answer no. However, we should also mention that no events for today. Also note that they might be away from home? There's an event at "Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill" which is away. But it's not today. So answer: "No, you don't have any personal calendar events away from home today."

          We must answer.
