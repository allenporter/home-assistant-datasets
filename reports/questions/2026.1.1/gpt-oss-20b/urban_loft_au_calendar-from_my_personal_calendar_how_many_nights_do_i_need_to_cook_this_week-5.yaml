          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user: "From my personal calendar, how many nights do I need to cook this week?" We need to use the calendar_get_events function. The question: "how many nights do I need to cook this week?" So we need to get events for personal calendar (calendar: "personal calendar"? The static context lists "calendar" as "Weather Service"? No. We have no calendar named "personal calendar". But the user refers to personal calendar. We need to call calendar_get_events with calendar: "personal calendar" and range: whole week. We can interpret the range string as a date range. We can call GetDateTime to get current date, compute week range. The instruction says: When asked if something happens, search the whole week. So we need to fetch events for the whole week. Use calendar_get_events.

          We need to provide a range. Likely we can use something like "2023-01-01/2023-01-08". But we need the current week. The assistant can call GetDateTime to get current date. Then we can compute start of week and end. The date format might be like "2023-01-01/2023-01-08". Let's just use ISO date. But we don't have date functions. We can ask the user to clarify? The instruction: When asking about calendar events, search whole week. So we need to get events for the week. We can approximate week as Monday to Sunday of current week. Use GetDateTime to get current date and time. Then compute start of week? We can just use GetDateTime to get now, but we need to supply range string. We can approximate as "2026-01-18/2026-01-25". But we don't know the day. The user: "From my personal calendar, how many nights do I need to cook this week?" That implies that we need to check events labeled "cook" or "cooking" maybe. But we don't have specific event classification. The calendar events might have title or location. We need to filter. But the function calendar_get_events probably returns events list with details. We then need to count nights. But we don't know which nights. But we can guess that each event with title containing "cook" or maybe "cooking" or "meal" indicates a night to cook. The assistant can just return the number of such events.

          We need to call calendar_get_events with calendar: "personal calendar" and range: "2026-01-18/2026-01-25". But we should use actual current week. Let's get current date from GetDateTime. Let's call GetDateTime.

          The current date is 2025-04-02 (Wednesday). We need to get the week. The week likely Monday to Sunday. Monday of current week is 2025-04-01, Sunday is 2025-04-07. Range: "2025-04-01/2025-04-08" maybe? The end is exclusive. So we use "2025-04-01/2025-04-08".

          Now call calendar_get_events.

          It seems the calendar name must be "Personal" (capital P). So we should use "Personal". Let's call again.

          Range must be "today" or "week". So we don't need to specify date; just use "week". So call with range "week".
