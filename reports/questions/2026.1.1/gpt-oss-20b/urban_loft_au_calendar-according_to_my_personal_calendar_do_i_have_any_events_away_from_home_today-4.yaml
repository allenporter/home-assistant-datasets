          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'We need to answer about calendar events. Use calendar_get_events.
          The question: "According to my personal calendar, do I have any events away
          from home today?" So we need to query calendar events. Which calendar? "personal
          calendar". The tool expects parameters: calendar: string, range: string.
          Likely we should ask for calendar name. But the static context may not include
          a calendar. But we can call calendar_get_events with calendar="personal"
          maybe. The tool signature: calendar_get_events(calendar, range). We can
          assume range: "today" or date. Probably use "2026-01-18". But user asked:
          any events away from home today. We might need to interpret events'' location.
          The tool returns RFC 5545 format. We need to parse if any events have location
          not "home" or location unspecified? The user asks "away from home". We need
          to find events today that are not at home. But the tool may not provide
          location. But we can still call calendar_get_events with range "today" or
          maybe "2026-01-18/2026-01-19". But we need to check location. We might need
          to parse the returned events. Let''s call the tool with range "2026-01-18".
          We''ll set calendar "personal". We''ll need to interpret results. But since
          we are just a text assistant, we need to call the tool. Let''s call it.'

          there is a static list of calendars. The error says value must be one of
          ['Personal']. So we should use "Personal" (capital P). Also, the range should
          be RFC 5545 date format. For a single day, maybe "2026-01-18T00:00:00Z/2026-01-19T00:00:00Z"
          or similar. Let's use "2026-01-18/2026-01-19". But the error indicates range
          must be RFC 5545, maybe "2026-01-18T00:00:00Z/2026-01-19T00:00:00Z". Let's
