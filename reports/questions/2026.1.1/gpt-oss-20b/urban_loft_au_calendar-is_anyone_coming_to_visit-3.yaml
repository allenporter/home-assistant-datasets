          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: |-
          The user asks: "Is anyone coming to visit?" This is a question about future events, possibly about calendar. We have calendar_get_events tool. We need to search events for the week. The question: "Is anyone coming to visit?" We can use calendar_get_events. We need to specify the calendar name and range. Which calendar? Not specified. There's a static context but no calendar name. We can assume "Calendar" or "Home Calendar". But not given. The calendar_get_events requires calendar: string, range: string. We can search the entire week. We should ask user for the calendar name or default. Since not specified, maybe ask clarifying? But the instruction: answer questions truthfully. We can attempt to call calendar_get_events with maybe "Calendar" and a range of next week. But we don't know the calendar name. We could say we need more info. But likely the user wants to know if any events. We can use calendar_get_events with a default calendar, maybe "Home Calendar" if exists. But not defined.

          Given the context, we can ask clarifying: "Which calendar should I check?" But the instruction says answer the question. We could search all calendars. We can ask: "Which calendar would you like me to check for events?" But we can also attempt to infer. The static context doesn't give calendar names. But we have a "Weather Service" domain. The user might ask "Is anyone coming to visit?" That likely means "Any events scheduled?" Without specifying a calendar, we can default to searching all calendars or the primary calendar. The tool requires a calendar name. We could try "Home" or "default". But maybe better to ask for clarification. However, we want to be helpful. We could say: "Let me check your calendar for any upcoming visitors. Is there a calendar named 'Home' or 'Personal'?" We could respond: "I don't have a calendar named 'Home'. Could you specify the calendar to check?" That might be best.

          Given the user didn't mention a calendar, we can ask them: "Which calendar should I check?" This is acceptable. We'll ask.
