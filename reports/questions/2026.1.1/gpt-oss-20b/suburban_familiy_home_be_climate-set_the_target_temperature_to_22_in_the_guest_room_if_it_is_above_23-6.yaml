          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          We need to interpret the request: "Set the target temperature to 22 in the guest room if it is above 23". This is a conditional. We need to check current temperature in Guest Room Thermostat Temperature sensor. Use GetLiveContext to get current temperature. Then if above 23, call HassClimateSetTemperature to set to 22. But the instructions: when controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. The device is Guest Room Thermostat, domain climate. So we need to call HassClimateSetTemperature with name "Guest Room Thermostat", area "Guest Room". The floor? It's not specified. Probably floor can be omitted or empty. The tool signature: { area, floor, name, temperature }. For domain we don't need to pass domain. But we may pass floor maybe blank. We need to check how to call. The instructions say "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." But tool signature doesn't have domain param. For HassClimateSetTemperature we pass area, floor, name, temperature. So we supply area "Guest Room", name "Guest Room Thermostat", temperature 22. floor maybe unspecified? We can pass empty string or omitted? The signature shows floor: string. Must provide. Maybe pass empty string. But might be optional? Probably required. We'll pass floor: "".

          Now, first call GetLiveContext to get current temperature. Then decide. The question: "Set the target temperature to 22 in the guest room if it is above 23". So we need to respond accordingly: If above 23, we set it. If not, we say nothing? We should indicate that it's not above 23, so no change. The user wants to set if above 23. So we will check current temp. Then if >23, call HassClimateSetTemperature. Then respond: "Setting the target temperature to 22°C." If not >23: "Current temperature is X°C, which is not above 23°C, so no change."

          We should first call GetLiveContext. Then process.

          Thus output: call GetLiveContext. Then process. Then call HassClimateSetTemperature if needed.

          We must only output tool calls? According to pattern, we return tool calls. We can include plain text after calls? The system may want to see the calls. Usually we must call the tool then respond. So first call GetLiveContext. Then process. Then call HassClimateSetTemperature if needed.

          Thus we produce a tool call for GetLiveContext. After receiving the result (not known to us) we decide. But we don't know the response format. In the conversation we can't simulate dynamic. But as ChatGPT, we might do: First call GetLiveContext, then after get result, decide. Since we can't do conditional logic within the system? We can chain: call GetLiveContext, then based on that we call HassClimateSetTemperature. But the assistant cannot do if logic without getting the result. We could do two calls: first GetLiveContext, then if condition satisfied, call HassClimateSetTemperature. But we can't know the result. But we can ask: we need to check. The instructions: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." They didn't mention returning anything else. So we can do:

          First tool call: GetLiveContext. Then based on that we decide.

          But in the assistant answer, we can embed the calls sequentially. The system might handle the responses. But we might need to combine. Perhaps we can do:

          {
            "name":"GetLiveContext",
            ...
          }

          Then after that, we need to use the result. But the tool invocation system may not allow us to conditionally branch. But we can do: call GetLiveContext, then call HassClimateSetTemperature. But that would set even if not above 23. But we can't know. But we can respond after we get the result.

          The best approach: call GetLiveContext. Then ask the user for confirmation? But the user requested to set only if above 23. We can do: call GetLiveContext to check, then evaluate and decide. We might respond with the result of GetLiveContext and if needed, call HassClimateSetTemperature. In this environment, we might not be able to wait for the tool result before making another tool call. But the typical pattern: we call GetLiveContext, then in the next turn we would handle the logic. However, the user expects immediate action. The assistant can perform a conditional using the tool result. I think we can do a single tool call that does the action? But we can't. We'll call GetLiveContext first.

          Thus we can output two calls: first GetLiveContext, then after we parse, call HassClimateSetTemperature. But we cannot parse here. But we can assume we can do this as the assistant. We'll structure:

          {
            "name":"GetLiveContext",
            "arguments": {}
          }

          Then next turn? But we can't. In some frameworks, we can provide a single tool call but we need to incorporate logic. The instructions say to use GetLiveContext for live data. So we must call it. Then we can do the action. So we will call GetLiveContext. After that, we need to call HassClimateSetTemperature. But we need to know current temperature to decide. So we can do: call GetLiveContext, then based on result, if >23, call HassClimateSetTemperature. This is best. We'll provide both calls sequentially.

          But the system may not support multi-step. But we can combine them into one tool call with the result? No. So we can do two calls. The first GetLiveContext. Then we can ask the system: "Based on the result of GetLiveContext, if the current temperature >23, set." But we can't decide.

          However, typical assistant might do: call GetLiveContext, then interpret result, then call set. But in this environment, we need to produce a single response that includes a call to GetLiveContext, and then we will handle the result and call set. But we cannot simulate that. But we can produce a chain: call GetLiveContext. Then in the next turn, we will call HassClimateSetTemperature if needed. But the user might not wait. I'm uncertain.

          Maybe we can respond: "Checking current temperature..." Then call GetLiveContext. Then after we have that, we will decide.

          Thus the assistant's reply: "Checking current temperature in Guest Room." Then call GetLiveContext. Then maybe we can include follow-up text? Usually we provide tool calls, not text. The system might not like text.

          But we can do: "Sure, checking temperature..." Then call GetLiveContext.

          Thus final: We produce a tool call. Then after that, we will produce a second call? The best approach: we call GetLiveContext, then we handle logic. Let's do:

          {
            "name": "GetLiveContext",
            "arguments": {}
          }

          After that, the assistant can respond with the next step. But we cannot do that in this single message. But maybe the platform supports multi-turn: the assistant calls GetLiveContext, receives response, then can proceed.

          Thus I will produce a single tool call to GetLiveContext, then we will respond that we will set if above 23. But not yet.

          Actually, to fulfill user request, we need to actually set. The user expects action.

          I think we should call GetLiveContext, then check. If above 23, we call HassClimateSetTemperature. But we can't know the value. However, we can assume we can call and then handle.

          Thus maybe we should call GetLiveContext and then call HassClimateSetTemperature unconditionally. But that would set even if not above 23. That might be incorrect.

          Alternatively, we could ask for current temperature: "What is the current temperature?" But the user didn't ask. But we can ask: "Current temperature in Guest Room?" That may be overkill.

          Better: we should call GetLiveContext to get the sensor value for Guest Room Thermostat Temperature. Then if >23, set. But we need to process.

          Let's produce two calls: GetLiveContext, then HassClimateSetTemperature. The second call may be conditional but we can call it.

          We'll produce a tool call to GetLiveContext. Then we will provide a second tool call to HassClimateSetTemperature. But we need to include name, area, temperature.

          Thus:

          {
            "name": "GetLiveContext",
            "arguments": {}
          }

          Then maybe we can also call HassClimateSetTemperature with temperature 22. The floor maybe empty string. So:

          {
            "name": "HassClimateSetTemperature",
            "arguments": {
              "area": "Guest Room",
              "floor": "",
              "name": "Guest Room Thermostat",
              "temperature": 22
            }
          }

          But instructions: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." The domain not in arguments. But we pass name.

          We need to specify domain? The tool doesn't have domain param.

          Thus final.

          Let's produce JSON array? But the instructions say use tool calls. I will produce a single tool call? But need two. The system might support multiple calls in same response.

          I'll do:

          {
            "name": "GetLiveContext",
            "arguments": {}
          }

          Then after receiving, do next. But I'll provide both.

          I'll write:

          {
            "name": "GetLiveContext",
            "arguments": {}
          }

          Then next message? But we need to respond in same.

          Given the pattern, I'd return the tool calls separately.

          I'll do the two calls: first GetLiveContext, then HassClimateSetTemperature.

          I think it's fine.

          The live context shows Guest Room Thermostat Temperature state is '21'. That's below 23. So we should not set the target temperature. The user wants to set target temp to 22 if above 23. Current is 21, so not above 23. So we respond: "The current temperature in the Guest Room is 21°C, which is not above 23°C, so no change."

          We should not call HassClimateSetTemperature. The request is conditional. So we simply reply.
