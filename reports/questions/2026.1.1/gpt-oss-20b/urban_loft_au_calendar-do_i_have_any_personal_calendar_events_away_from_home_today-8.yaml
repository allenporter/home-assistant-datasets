          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          We need to query calendar events. Use calendar_get_events. The user asks: "Do I have any personal calendar events away from home today?" That requires checking events for the whole week. We can call calendar_get_events. It requires calendar and range. Likely calendar: "personal" maybe. But from static context we only have names. Not sure. There's no mention of calendar names. But we have "calendar_get_events" function. We'll assume calendar "personal" or "home" etc. The question: "away from home" implies we want events with location not home. We need to query events for today. The function requires calendar and range string. We'll use calendar "personal" and range "2023-...". But we don't know date. We could use GetDateTime to get current date. We'll get current date. Then call calendar_get_events with range "today". But function signature expects string range. We'll supply "2023-09-27" etc. We can just use "today". Might not be correct. We could call calendar_get_events for the week. Let's do that.

          We need to call GetDateTime to get current date. Then get events for range week. Then filter. Let's just call calendar_get_events with calendar "personal" and range "today". The function returns events. Then we can check location.

          But we can't parse event details easily. But we can just answer if any event has location != home. We'll return something like "You have a meeting at 3pm in New York" etc. But we need data. We have no actual events. But we must call the tool.

          Let's do: call GetDateTime to get current date. Then call calendar_get_events with calendar "personal" and range "2026-01-18T00:00:00/2026-01-19T00:00:00" (just one day). But tool expects string.

          We will call with calendar "personal" and range "today". Let's do.

          Tool expects calendar names. Only known name is "Weather Service"? The calendar maybe "Weather Service"? But that's weather. Hmm.

          Static context didn't list a calendar. Might be default calendar. The function might require specific calendar name. We can try "Home" or "Personal". But tool errors.

          We might need to provide "calendar" field as "Personal". But tool says must be one of ['Personal']. Wait error shows dictionary value @ data['calendar'] must be one of ['Personal']. That indicates the allowed value is "Personal" (capitalized). The error shows it's complaining that value must be one of ['Personal'] for dictionary value. So we need to supply "Personal" exactly.

          Let's call again.

          We have events: Chemistry class (location None) and Dinner with Liza (location Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill). The user asks: "Do i have any personal calendar events away from home today?" The first event location None may be home? Not sure. The second event location is a restaurant. So yes, there is an away event. We can answer: Yes, you have a dinner at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill. Also, maybe the chemistry class? If location None, maybe it's at home. So we answer accordingly.

          Let's respond: Yes, you have a dinner at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill. Also, your chemistry class likely at home or school. So yes.
