          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user asks: "Are we leaving the house today?" This is a question about current state? "Are we leaving the house today?" could be interpreted as "Is the house going to be left (vacant) today?" It might refer to whether the house is scheduled to be empty. This is not directly a static context. It could be a question about scheduled events or user plans. It could be about calendar events. Could ask the calendar_get_events tool. Probably we need to call calendar_get_events for the user's calendar to see events for today. However no calendar name provided. But static context includes "Weather Service" but no calendar. The user might want to know if they plan to leave the house today. This is not a current state but a question about plans. We should interpret as "Are there any events scheduled for today that involve leaving the house?" Might need to ask for calendar name. But static context doesn't specify a calendar. So we might need to call calendar_get_events with "calendar" unknown. Maybe we can ask user for calendar name. But per instructions: The assistant should answer questions truthfully. If the user asks about leaving the house today, maybe it's about current state: Are we currently away? If the user means "Are we going to leave the house today?" maybe we need to check calendar. Since we don't know calendar name, maybe we can ask the user. But the instruction says: "When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools." There's no instruction for asking clarifications. But we can answer "I'm not sure" if we lack data. But the user likely expects a response. We might check GetLiveContext if there is some sensor for presence? No presence sensor in static context. No "presence" sensor. The question is ambiguous. But maybe it's about "Are we leaving the house today?" meaning "Will we be home or not?" We could check if any events scheduled for today that involve leaving. Could call calendar_get_events with a generic calendar name, but we don't know.

          Better approach: Ask clarifying question: "Which calendar should I check for events?" But the instructions say keep it simple and to the point. Maybe we can answer: "I don't have a calendar to check. Could you specify which calendar I should look at?" But also maybe the assistant can check "GetLiveContext" for presence sensors or a "home" area state? But we don't have that. So best: ask user to specify calendar. But maybe we can try to check "GetLiveContext" for "presence" but no sensor.

          Thus: I'll ask user: "Could you tell me which calendar you want me to check?" Or I can assume "Calendar" is called "Events". But no such entity. So ask.

          But maybe the assistant can interpret as "Are we leaving the house today?" meaning "Are we currently not at home?" The user might have an "away" state set by a group. Not present. So we can't answer.

          Thus, I'll ask clarifying question.
