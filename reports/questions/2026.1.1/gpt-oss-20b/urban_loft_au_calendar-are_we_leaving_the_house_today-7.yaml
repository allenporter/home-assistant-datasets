          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          events that might indicate you’re leaving the house.
        thinking_content: 'The user asks: "Are we leaving the house today?" This is
          a question about schedule: is the user leaving the house today? We do not
          have any calendar events info? There''s a calendar_get_events function.
          They might want to know if there''s a planned event. This question is not
          about the current state of a device. It''s about a schedule. The question
          is about whether the user is leaving today. We need to check calendar events.
          Use calendar_get_events with calendar: maybe "Calendar" or "Home Calendar"?
          The static context lists no calendar name. We can guess calendar name: "Calendar"
          or maybe "Home" or "Events"? There''s no defined calendar name in static
          context. We could ask user for calendar name or maybe there''s a default
          calendar: maybe "Calendar". The user is asking about leaving the house:
          maybe they want to know if they have any scheduled leaving events today.
          We can call calendar_get_events with calendar: "Calendar" or "Home Calendar"
          or "Personal Calendar" and range: "today" or "2023-01-??" The tool expects
          a range string. We need to provide a range: maybe "2026-01-18T00:00:00Z/2026-01-19T00:00:00Z"?
          Or "today". The tool''s description: calendar_get_events: range string.
          The user says "Are we leaving the house today?" We can interpret: check
          events that indicate leaving. But the calendar may not have that detail.
          Maybe we can answer: We don''t have info about your leaving. But we can
          ask them to check the calendar. Or we can ask them to specify event. According
          to instructions: For scheduling questions, we can call calendar_get_events.
          We need to supply range: The week. The tool expects a range string. Let''s
          use "2026-01-18/2026-01-25" or "2026-01-18T00:00:00Z/2026-01-25T00:00:00Z".
          Let''s choose "2026-01-18/2026-01-25". Calendar name: "Calendar" maybe.
          There''s no defined calendar name. But likely it''s "Calendar" or "Home".
          Let''s ask user: "Which calendar should I check?" But instructions say to
          answer. We might need to guess. I''d answer: I can''t tell if you''re leaving
          today without your calendar. Could ask to check your calendar. Let''s respond
          asking for calendar name or confirm.'
