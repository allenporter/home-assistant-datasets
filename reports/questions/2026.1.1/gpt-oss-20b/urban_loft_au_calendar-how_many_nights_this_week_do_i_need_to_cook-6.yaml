          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          We need to understand user question: "How many nights this week do I need to cook?" This is likely a question about a to-do list: tasks that involve cooking? They want to know how many nights this week cooking tasks are on their todo list. They have a todo list "Tasks". We need to query the todo list for items in this week that involve cooking. But do we have any context of tasks? The static context says only the existence of a todo list, but not its contents. We need to use the tool todo_get_items to query the todo list. But we need to filter by status? Probably we need to get incomplete items. But also need to filter by date range? The todo_get_items function accepts status and todo_list. It does not accept date filters. There's no filter for date. Maybe we need to get items for this week by checking the items. But since we don't have date info, we might need to get all items, then determine which are cooking tasks. But the tool only returns items but doesn't provide details. But maybe the tool returns items with their description or due dates? The spec says it returns items, but we don't know structure. Likely it returns an array of items with details. We need to call the function.

          Thus we should call todo_get_items with status "needs_action" and todo_list "Tasks". Then examine the result and see how many tasks are cooking-related and scheduled for this week. But we don't have date context. But we can ask for the tasks, then check if any mention cooking. The tool will give details; we can parse. But we don't know actual content. However, we need to produce an answer: the number of nights this week you need to cook. That requires knowledge of tasks due this week. The system says we have GetLiveContext for real-time data, but not for static todo items. But we can use todo_get_items. The user didn't provide the tasks. We need to ask the tool. So we should call todo_get_items. Then we need to interpret. However, we can't call the tool in conversation directly; we must produce a function call. But we are ChatGPT, and we have to produce a function call. But we are not asked to give the result? We need to produce answer. But we need to call the tool. So we must first request the function. So we should call todo_get_items.

          Thus the answer will be: call the function. But we can also mention that we need to check tasks. But the instruction says: "When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock." For non-Home Assistant queries, we can just answer.

          Thus we need to call the function todo_get_items. We'll pass status "needs_action" and todo_list "Tasks".

          Let's produce the function call.
