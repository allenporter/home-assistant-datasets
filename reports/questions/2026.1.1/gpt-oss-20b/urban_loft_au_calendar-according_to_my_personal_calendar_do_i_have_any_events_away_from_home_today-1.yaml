          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          any events away from home today?" We need to check calendar events for today.
          The calendar_get_events tool. Provide calendar name: personal calendar?
          The static context lists only "Weather Service" calendar, but maybe personal
          calendar is "calendar". Likely use calendar_get_events. We must provide
          range of whole week. Use calendar_get_events with calendar: "Personal" maybe?
          But we don''t know. We should ask user for calendar name. But likely it''s
          "Personal". We can call tool: calendar_get_events with calendar "personal"
          and range whole week. Let''s try "Personal" or "personal". Use "Personal"
          maybe. The function signature: calendar_get_events({calendar: string, range:
          string}). We need a range string. It expects RFC 5545 which means end exclusive.
          We need to give a range for whole week. We can use something like "2026-01-18T00:00:00/2026-01-25T00:00:00".
          Use date/time. We can get current date with GetDateTime. Let''s call GetDateTime
          to get now, then compute start of week? But we can just set range to this
          week start. Simpler: ask the tool: range: "2026-01-18T00:00:00/2026-01-25T00:00:00".
          We''ll use "Personal" calendar. Provide that. Then interpret response. But
          we need to respond. Let''s call the tool.'
