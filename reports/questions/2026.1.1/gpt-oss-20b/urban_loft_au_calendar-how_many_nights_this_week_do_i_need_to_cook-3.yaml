          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'User asks "How many nights this week do I need to cook?"
          This likely refers to a to-do list or a schedule. They want to know how
          many nights this week they need to cook. Probably check calendar events
          for cooking tasks. Use calendar_get_events? The question: "How many nights
          this week do I need to cook?" Could be from calendar. Likely need to check
          events for "cook" or tasks? The user might have events scheduled: like "Cook
          dinner" events. We need to call calendar_get_events with calendar name "Kitchen"
          or something? We need a calendar name. The static context doesn''t list
          a calendar. But maybe there''s a calendar. The instructions say use calendar_get_events
          to get events from a calendar. We need to specify calendar name and range.
          The user didn''t specify a calendar, so we could default to "Calendar"?
          Might need to ask. But user question: "How many nights this week do I need
          to cook?" Could be answered by checking their calendar for events containing
          "cook". But we don''t know calendar name. We can try calendar_get_events
          with a generic calendar name "Calendar" or "Events"? The best approach:
          ask user to specify which calendar. But maybe we can assume default calendar
          "Calendar". In instructions: we should call calendar_get_events. Probably
          we need to ask user which calendar. But question seems direct. Perhaps we
          can assume their calendar is "Calendar". Let''s try to call calendar_get_events
          with calendar "Calendar" and range "this week". But we need RFC 5545 format
          for range? The tool signature: calendar_get_events takes calendar (string)
          and range (string). Range: maybe "2023-09-01T00:00:00Z/2023-09-07T23:59:59Z"?
          We can just give "this week". The instructions say when asked if something
          happens, search the whole week. So we can pass range "this week". Let''s
          do that. Then we need to parse events. The tool will return events. We need
          to count nights that have "cook" in the summary or description. Without
          the tool output, we can''t answer. So we must call calendar_get_events.'
