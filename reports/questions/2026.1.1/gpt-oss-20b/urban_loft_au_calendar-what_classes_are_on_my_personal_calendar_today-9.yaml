          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'The user asks: "What classes are on my personal calendar
          today?" This is a question about calendar events. According to the tool
          list, there''s a function calendar_get_events. We should call that to get
          events for the user''s personal calendar for today. The function requires
          parameters: calendar: string, range: string. We need to decide what calendar
          name. The question is "my personal calendar". We don''t have a name; maybe
          "personal calendar". The range: "today" maybe. The range likely needs RFC
          5545? But the function signature expects string. We can provide "today".
          Let''s call calendar_get_events with calendar="personal", range="today".
          But we might use "Personal Calendar" or "personal". For safety, use "Personal".
          The user is likely using a calendar named "personal" or "Personal". Let''s
          call the function with "personal" calendar name. Use "today" as range. Then
          use response.'

          Might need a time range. Maybe we should use "2026-01-18T00:00:00Z/2026-01-18T23:59:59Z"
          or something. But the tool signature says "range: string" and doc: "Get

          week. Results are RFC 5545 which means ''end'' is exclusive." It may accept
          a time range. The question is "today". So we can provide "today" or maybe
          a proper RFC 5545 date-time range. Let''s provide "2026-01-18/2026-01-19"
          maybe. But let''s try "2026-01-18T00:00:00Z/2026-01-19T00:00:00Z". Use "Personal"

          is 2026-01-18. The tool returned events from April 2025, not today. Maybe
          the function didn''t work correctly. We need to handle this. Possibly the
          calendar is not configured correctly. Could be that "Personal" doesn''t
          have events for today. We can answer that there are no classes today. But
          we need to be truthful. Since the tool returned events that are not today,
          maybe it returned all events because we used "today"? But the times are
          2025-04-02. That might be wrong. We could ask the user to confirm the calendar
          name. Or we can interpret that there are no classes today. But the tool
          gave some events. They include a "Chemistry class" and "Dinner with Liza".
          The "Chemistry class" is a class, but it''s on 2025-04-02. But today is
          2026-01-18. So probably there are no classes today. Let''s answer: "There
          are no classes scheduled on your personal calendar today."'
