          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'User asks "What classes do I have today?" That is likely
          asking about calendar events. We need to call calendar_get_events for the
          relevant calendar? We have a calendar named "Weather Service"? No, that''s
          a weather sensor. But "Tasks" is a todo list. But user likely means schedule
          of classes. There''s no calendar name provided. The system doesn''t mention
          any calendar. However we might need to call calendar_get_events with the
          calendar name "Tasks"? Not correct. There''s no calendar for classes. Might
          be a calendar "Calendar" or "Home Calendar". No info. The instruction: For
          queries about calendar, call calendar_get_events. But need calendar name.
          The user didn''t specify. Perhaps we need to ask clarification? The question:
          "What classes do I have today?" Could be asking about classes scheduled
          for today in the user''s calendar. We can try to call calendar_get_events
          with a generic calendar "Calendar" for the week range of today? The instruction:
          "When asked if something happens, search the whole week." But we need to
          specify calendar name and range. We can guess calendar name "Calendar" maybe?
          Might be "My Calendar". Not sure. Possibly we should ask clarification:
          "Which calendar?" But perhaps the home has a calendar named "My Calendar"
          or "Work Calendar". There''s no mention. We can say "I don''t have that
          info" but the instructions say not to say lack of functionality. Instead
          we need to call tool to get events. We might call calendar_get_events with
          calendar "Calendar" and range "2026-01-18/2026-01-25" for the week. But
          uncertain. The question is about classes. We might interpret that we need
          to return events with class type. We''ll attempt to get events from a calendar
          named "Calendar". If fails, maybe we need to ask user. But guidelines: "When
          a user asks to turn on all devices... ask user to specify area". Not relevant.
          For calendar, we can ask for clarification? The instructions don''t mention
          explicitly asking for clarification. We should call tool. But we don''t
          know calendar name. We can try to guess "Calendar". Provide range as whole
          week starting today. We''ll call calendar_get_events with calendar "Calendar"
          and range "2026-01-18/2026-01-25".'
