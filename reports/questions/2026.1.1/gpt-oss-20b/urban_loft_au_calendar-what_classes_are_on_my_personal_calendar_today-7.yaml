          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'The user asks: "What classes are on my personal calendar
          today?" We need to check calendar. We have a calendar_get_events tool. The
          user wants personal calendar events for today. We should use calendar_get_events
          with calendar: "personal" or something? The static context doesn''t define
          calendar names. The question: "What classes are on my personal calendar
          today?" Likely we need to query a calendar. We need to call calendar_get_events
          with calendar = "personal" or "Personal Calendar"? We need to specify the
          calendar name. Since we don''t know the exact name, but we can guess "personal"
          or "Personal". The instructions: "Get events from a calendar. When asked
          if something happens, search the whole week. Results are RFC 5545 which
          means ''end'' is exclusive." So we can call with calendar: "personal" and
          range: maybe the date range for today. Should we ask for the range? We can
          specify range: "2026-01-18/2026-01-19" as inclusive start exclusive end.

        thinking_content: 'We got events. They are from 2025-04-02? But the user asked
          for today 2026-01-18. The tool returned events for 2025-04-02? That seems
          wrong. Maybe the calendar contains past events. Anyway, we can present the
          events. However, the date is wrong. We might need to convert to local time?
          The tool output shows start date. But it''s 2025-04-02. That may not be
          relevant. The user asked for today. The tool returned events for a different
          date. The tool may not have events for today. We should mention that there
          are no classes today? But it shows Chemistry class. However, the date is
          in April 2025, which is in the future relative to current date. So likely
          those are upcoming events. So we should interpret "today" means current
          date, but the tool returned events for 2025-04-02. That is not today. So
          we should say no classes today. We might check again? We can ask again?
          Probably it''s okay to say no classes today. But maybe we should trust the
          tool. The tool responded with events on 2025-04-02. That is not today. So
          we should answer that there are no classes today. Let''s say: "You have
          no classes scheduled for today."'

          questions about current conditions (e.g., ''Is the light on?''). 2. As the
          first step in conditional actions (e.g., ''If the weather is rainy, turn
          off sprinklers'' requires checking the weather first).'
