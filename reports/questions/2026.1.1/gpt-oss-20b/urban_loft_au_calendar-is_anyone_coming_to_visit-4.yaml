          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'The user asks: "Is anyone coming to visit?" That requires
          current events: "Anyone coming to visit?" They want to check calendar events
          for visitors. The tool `calendar_get_events` can retrieve events. The question
          asks about if someone is coming to visit, presumably within the next week?
          According to instructions: When asking about something happening, search
          the whole week. So we should call calendar_get_events for the calendar "some
          calendar". But static context doesn''t mention a calendar name. There is
          no specific calendar name provided. But maybe default calendar is "calendar"?
          But we have a tool signature: calendar_get_events with calendar: string,
          range: string. We need to pick a calendar name. In many Home Assistant setups,
          calendar name could be "Calendar". But we don''t know. We might ask for
          clarification. But the user is asking "Is anyone coming to visit?" The best
          approach: Use calendar_get_events to get events for the whole week from
          maybe "Calendar". But we need to supply a calendar name. The instructions:
          "Get events from a calendar. When asked if something happens, search the
          whole week." So we should call calendar_get_events with calendar: "Calendar"
          (likely default) and range: "next 7 days" or "now-7d" etc. But maybe we
          need a date range: "now-7d". The tool signature requires a range string.
          Possibly a RFC 5545 format: "2026-01-18T00:00:00Z/2026-01-25T00:00:00Z"?
          Hard to guess. We can use something generic like "2026-01-18/2026-01-25"?
          But instructions: "search the whole week." We can just use "next week".
          But maybe we can ask user for calendar name. But better to attempt default.
          Use calendar: "Calendar" maybe. Or "Calendar" could be "Calendar" entity
          name. Let''s use "Calendar" as calendar name. Range: "now-7d". Or "2026-01-18/2026-01-25".
          But we don''t have exact tool constraints. It''s likely just string. So
          let''s call calendar_get_events with calendar: "Calendar" and range: "next
          week". Let''s do that.'
