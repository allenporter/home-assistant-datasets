          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'We need to check calendar events. The user asks: "Is anyone
          coming to visit?" That''s a question about whether there are upcoming events
          in the week presumably. We need to call the calendar_get_events tool. We
          need to determine which calendar. Likely the calendar is the user calendar.
          The tool signature: calendar_get_events(calendar: string, range: string).
          We need to provide a calendar name and a range. The question "Is anyone
          coming to visit?" implies upcoming events in the week. We need to ask what
          calendar? The user likely has a calendar set up. In the system, we can use
          "calendar_get_events" with calendar name. The instructions: "Get events
          from a calendar. When asked if something happens, search the whole week.
          Results are RFC 5545 which means ''end'' is exclusive." So we should call
          calendar_get_events with calendar: "Calendar" or maybe "Calendar" is the
          name? The user didn''t specify. We need to guess a calendar name. Maybe
          it''s "Calendar" or "Personal" etc. The static context does not mention
          a calendar. But the tool is available. We''ll assume the default calendar
          is "Calendar". Use range: whole week. We need to format the date range string.
          We need a date range covering the week. The current date is 2026-01-18.
          Whole week: Monday to next Monday? We can use ISO format? Usually range
          is an RFC 5545 date/time. But the tool signature just takes a string. Probably
          we can give a range like "2026-01-16/2026-01-23" (Monday to next Monday).
          Let''s do that. So we call calendar_get_events with calendar="Calendar"
          and range="2026-01-16/2026-01-23". Then respond after tool.'
