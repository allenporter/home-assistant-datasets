          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'User asks: "Am I leaving the house today?" We need to answer
          based on calendar events? The question: They might have calendar events
          for leaving the house. Use calendar_get_events? We can ask to search events
          for this week. The user asks if they are leaving the house today. We need
          to query calendar events for today. Use calendar_get_events tool. The question:
          "search the whole week." We can ask for the calendar named "calendar" presumably.
          But we don''t know the calendar name. In static context we have "Weather
          Service" but no calendar. But the instruction: "Get events from a calendar.
          When asked if something happens, search the whole week. Results are RFC
          5545 which means ''end'' is exclusive." So we can call the tool. We need
          to specify calendar name. The user didn''t specify which calendar. Usually
          there is a default calendar "calendar" maybe. We can call calendar_get_events
          with calendar: "default" maybe? But we need to follow tool signature: calendar_get_events({_calendar:
          string, range: string}). We need to provide a range string: probably "now/now+7d"
          or "2024-01-18T00:00:00Z/2024-01-25T00:00:00Z"? We can ask the user to confirm.
          But we can attempt to call with "default" or "calendar". We''ll assume "calendar"
          is the name. Range "now/now+7d" is common. We''ll call tool.'

          (system date). So there are no events today? We only have events for 2025-04-02.
          So we can infer no events scheduled today. But maybe the calendar is not
          up to date. We should answer: No, you are not leaving the house today, as
          no events in the calendar. But the user might ask "Am I leaving the house
          today?" If the calendar does not indicate leaving, answer accordingly. We''ll
          say: Based on your calendar, you have no events scheduled for leaving the
          house today.'
