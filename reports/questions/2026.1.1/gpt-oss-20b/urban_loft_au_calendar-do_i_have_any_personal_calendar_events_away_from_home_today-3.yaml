          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          User asks: "Do I have any personal calendar events away from home today?" We need to answer about calendar events for the week. According to instructions: "Get events from a calendar. When asked if something happens, search the whole week. Results are RFC 5545 which means 'end' is exclusive." So we need to call calendar_get_events with calendar and range. The user didn't specify calendar name; but likely personal calendar events away from home: we need to query events. The instruction: If asked about calendar events, we need to use the calendar_get_events tool. The calendar name? The user might have "Personal Calendar". We need to guess or ask for clarification? We can assume the personal calendar is "Personal Calendar". Let's call tool with calendar "Personal Calendar" and range "2026-01-18/2026-01-25" (one week). The question: "away from home today". We need to check events today that are not at home. We don't know the home location; maybe we can check events with location not "Home". The tool will return RFC 5545 events. We can parse. But we need to ask the tool. So call calendar_get_events with calendar: "Personal Calendar" and range: "2026-01-18/2026-01-25".

          We do that.

          seems wrong. Probably the tool uses a default example. We need to use today''s
          date? The tool probably is not correct. The instruction: "When asked if
          something happens, search the whole week." So range should be "week". It
          returned events in 2025. That may be the only events. We need to answer:
          "Do I have any personal calendar events away from home today?" The events
          returned: one event at location "None" (Chemistry class), another at location
          "Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill". The user asked about "away from home
          today". Today is 2026-01-18. There are no events for 2026-01-18. So answer:
          No events away from home today. Use tool''s data? We can answer: No, there
          are no personal calendar events away from home today.'
