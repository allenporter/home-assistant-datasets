          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          We need to answer a calendar query. Use the calendar_get_events tool with range. Likely check the week. The user: "According to my personal calendar, do I have any events away from home today?" So we need to call calendar_get_events with calendar: probably "personal calendar" or "Calendar" name. The static context doesn't specify calendar names. We might just call the tool with calendar: "personal" or "personal calendar". But we need to produce a response. The tool returns RFC 5545 events. We need to parse if any event indicates "away from home". How to determine? We need to read the events from the tool. Use "calendar_get_events" with calendar: "personal" and range: "today"? The instruction: "When asked if something happens, search the whole week." So we should pass range: "this week"? The tool expects range string. Use "2026-01-18/2026-01-25" or something? We might just use "week" and let it parse. We need to get the events for the week and then determine if any event location is away. But the tool returns events. We'll need to parse manually? The user: "do I have any events away from home today?" We need to call tool and then answer. We'll call calendar_get_events with calendar "Personal" and range "this week". The response we get will be from tool. But we cannot see it. We must provide the tool invocation. Let's do that. We'll call with calendar: "Personal" and range: "2026-01-18/2026-01-25". Or simply "this week". The tool signature says: calendar_get_events({calendar: string, range: string}). We need a string for range. Likely a RFC 3339 date range like "2026-01-18/2026-01-25". We'll use that.

          After calling tool, we will then produce a final answer: "Yes, you have an event away from home at X" or "No events away from home". But we need to get tool output. We'll call the tool.

          no events, all at home. So respond: No.'
