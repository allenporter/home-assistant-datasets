          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'The user says: "If the temperature in the guest room is
          above 23 then set the target temperature to 22." We need to check current
          temperature. Use GetLiveContext. Then if >23, set target. But we can''t
          do conditional in one call. We need to check live context. So call GetLiveContext
          to get the current temperature. Then based on that, decide. If it''s above
          23, we set climate. The device is Guest Room Thermostat, domain climate.
          The target temperature should be 22. Use HassClimateSetTemperature. Need
          area, floor? We have area: Guest Room. domain: climate. We pass name: Guest
          Room Thermostat. Temperature: 22. We don''t have floor. Possibly leave floor
          empty string. Use domain as climate. The instructions: "When controlling
          a device, prefer passing just name and domain." So pass name: Guest Room
          Thermostat, domain: climate. So tool: HassClimateSetTemperature with area=Guest
          Room, floor= maybe none, name=Guest Room Thermostat, temperature=22. And
          we should call GetLiveContext first. The tool: GetLiveContext. We''ll need
          to parse response. I need to simulate calling it. But as ChatGPT I should
          call the tool. So first call GetLiveContext. Then if result indicates temperature
          >23, call HassClimateSetTemperature. If not, do nothing. I should phrase
          answer. But guidelines: "When controlling Home Assistant always call the
          intent tools." We need to use tool calls. So we do two calls. We''ll call
          GetLiveContext. Then if condition true, call HassClimateSetTemperature.
          I''ll need to write the tool calls.'
