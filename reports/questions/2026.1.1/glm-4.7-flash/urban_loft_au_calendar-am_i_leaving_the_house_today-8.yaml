  Based on your calendar for today, you have two events:

  1. **Chemistry class** at 11:00 AM (location: none - appears to be online or at home)
  2. **Dinner with Liza** at 7:00 PM at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill

  You do have an appointment that involves going out (the dinner), but I don't have information about your travel arrangements or whether you need to leave before that appointment.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user is asking if they are leaving the house today. To answer this question accurately, I need to check their calendar for today's events and see if there are any that indicate they're leaving or going somewhere. I should use the calendar_get_events function with "today" as the range to see what events are scheduled for today.

          Looking at the available functions, I can use `calendar_get_events` with calendar "Personal" and range "today" to see their schedule for today.
