          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: |-
          The user is asking about their calendar to see if anyone is visiting. To answer this question, I need to check their calendar events. I should use the calendar_get_events function to see what's scheduled. Since they're asking about visitors, I should probably look at the current week to see if there are any events that might indicate visitors.

          Let me call the calendar_get_events function with "week" as the range to get the week's events.

          birthday (all day).
        thinking_content: |-
          Looking at the calendar events, I can see:

          1. "Cook Dinner" events on April 2nd and April 5th (both at home)
          2. "Liza visit" on April 5th-7th (all day, at home)
          3. "Cynthia's Birthday" on April 6th (all day)
          4. "Cook Dinner" on April 5th (evening)

          Yes, there is a visit scheduled! Liza is visiting from April 5th to April 7th. This is clearly a visitor event since it's just listed as "visit" and doesn't mention cooking or other activities.
