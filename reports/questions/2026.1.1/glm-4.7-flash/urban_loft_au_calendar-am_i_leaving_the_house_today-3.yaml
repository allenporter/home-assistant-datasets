  Based on your calendar, you do have two events today that could involve leaving the house:

  1. **Chemistry class** at 11:00 AM - No location specified
  2. **Dinner with Liza** at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill from 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM

  The dinner with Liza is definitely going to require you to go out to a restaurant. Whether the chemistry class also involves leaving home depends on whether it's at a different location than your usual routine.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user is asking if they are leaving the house today. This requires checking their current state and schedule to determine if they have any commitments or travel planned. I should check their calendar for today's events to see if they have any appointments, meetings, or trips scheduled.

          Let me use the calendar_get_events function to check what's happening today.

          Based on the calendar events for today, I can see there are two events:

          1. Chemistry class from 11:00 AM to 11:55 AM - no location specified
          2. Dinner with Liza at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM

          The dinner with Liza appears to be a social event that might involve going out, and it's at a restaurant location. This could be considered "leaving the house" for the evening. However, the chemistry class might also require going to a different location (school/college).

          I should present this information to the user and let them decide if these count as leaving the house for them.
