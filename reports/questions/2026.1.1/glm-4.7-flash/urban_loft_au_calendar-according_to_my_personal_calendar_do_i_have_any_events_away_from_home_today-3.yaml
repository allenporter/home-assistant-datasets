          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user is asking about their personal calendar events for today. They specifically want to know if they have any events that are "away from home" today.

          Looking at the available functions, I can see there's a `calendar_get_events` function that can get events from a calendar. The function takes:
          - calendar: "Personal" (this matches what the user asked for)
          - range: "today" (this matches what they're asking about)

          The function description says "Results are RFC 5545 which means 'end' is exclusive."

          However, I need to be careful about the "away from home" part. The calendar_get_events function will return all events, but I don't have a way to determine which ones are "away from home" just from the event data. I should get the events first and then see what information is available, but I may need to ask the user to clarify or I may need to look at the event details to determine if they're at home or away.

          Let me start by calling the function to get today's events from the Personal calendar.
