          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user is asking about who they are meeting for dinner. This is a question about their personal schedule/calendar, which would require looking at their calendar events. I have access to a calendar_get_events function that can get events from their calendar.

          Let me check what calendars are available - the enum shows "Personal" as the only option. The function can get events for "today" or "week" range.

          Since the user is asking about who they're meeting for dinner, this likely refers to a calendar event. I should use the calendar_get_events function with the "Personal" calendar and the "week" range to see what dinner-related events they have coming up.

          Perfect! I found the answer. Looking at the calendar events for the week, I can see there's a dinner event:

          "Dinner with Liza" on April 2nd from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill, with a note about bringing flowers.

          So the user is meeting Liza for dinner.
