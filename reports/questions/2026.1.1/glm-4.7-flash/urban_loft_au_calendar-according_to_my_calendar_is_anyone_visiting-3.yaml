          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        content: I'll check your calendar for the current week to see if you have
          any visitors scheduled.
        thinking_content: |-
          The user is asking about their calendar to see if anyone is visiting. To answer this question, I need to:

          1. Get the current date/time to understand what day we're on
          2. Check their calendar for the current week to see if there are any events

          Looking at the available functions, I can see:
          - `GetDateTime` - to get current date and time
          - `calendar_get_events` - to get events from a calendar

          From the static context, I can see there's a calendar called "Personal" available. The calendar_get_events function takes a calendar parameter (with enum ["Personal"]) and a range parameter (with enum ["today", "week"]).

          Since the user is asking "is anyone visiting" and wants to know about current calendar, I should check the current week to see if there are any events that might indicate visitors.

          Let me first get the current date/time, then check the calendar for the week.

        thinking_content: |-
          Looking at the calendar results, I can see there are several events for the current week (starting from today, April 2nd, 2025):

          1. "Cook Dinner" on April 2nd from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM
          2. "Liza visit" on April 5-7 (all day event)
          3. "Cynthia's Birthday" on April 6-7 (all day event)
          4. "Cook Dinner" on April 5th from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM

          The most relevant visitor information is the "Liza visit" event on April 5-7. This appears to be a multi-day visit. I should also note that April 6th is Cynthia's birthday, but that's not a visitor event.

          So yes, someone is visiting - Liza is visiting from April 5th through April 7th.
