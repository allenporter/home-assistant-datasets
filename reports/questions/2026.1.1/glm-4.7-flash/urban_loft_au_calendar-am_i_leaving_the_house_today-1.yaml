  I can see you have some activities scheduled for today:

  - **Chemistry class** at 11:00 AM (no location specified - could be online or at home)
  - **Dinner with Liza** at 7:00 PM at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill

  I don't have real-time information about your current location or immediate plans, so I can't tell you if you're leaving the house right now. Based on your calendar, it looks like you have something going on this evening, but I don't have details about your current whereabouts.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          I can see from the calendar that there are two events today:
          1. Chemistry class at 11:00 AM - no location specified, so this could be online or at the house
          2. Dinner with Liza at 7:00 PM at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill - this is definitely going to be at an off-site location

          However, I still don't know if they're actually leaving the house *right now* or if these events are still in the future. To get a better sense of their current activity, I should check their todo list to see if there are any tasks related to leaving the house or getting ready to go.

          I also checked the todo list but there are no pending tasks.

          From this information, I can tell the user has activities scheduled today, but I don't have specific information about whether they are leaving the house *right now*. The Chemistry class could be online or at the house, and the dinner is definitely going to be at a restaurant.

          I should be honest that I can see they have activities today but I don't have real-time information about their current location or immediate plans.
