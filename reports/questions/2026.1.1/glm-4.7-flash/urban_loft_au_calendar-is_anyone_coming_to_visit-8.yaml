          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user is asking "Is anyone coming to visit?" - this sounds like they want to know if they have any visitors scheduled. To answer this question, I should check their calendar for today or the upcoming week to see if there are any events or appointments that might indicate someone coming to visit.

          I can use the `calendar_get_events` function to check their calendar. Since they're asking about visitors, I should check the current day and the week to give them comprehensive information. Let me check for today and this week.

          Great! Now I have a complete picture. Looking at the calendar:

          1. Today (April 2nd): "Cook Dinner" from 7:00-8:30 PM at home
          2. April 5-7: "Liza visit" all day (so Liza is coming to visit)
          3. April 6: "Cynthia's Birthday" (all day) - this is a birthday call reminder
          4. April 5: "Cook Dinner" from 7:00-8:30 PM at home

          So yes, there is someone coming to visit - Liza is scheduled to visit on April 5-7th.
