  Based on your calendar, you do have an appointment today that likely involves leaving the house:

  **Dinner with Liza** at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill - 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM

  You also have a Chemistry class at 11:00 AM, but no location is specified for that.

  So yes, you are likely leaving the house today for your dinner with Liza!

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user is asking "Am I leaving the house today?" - this is asking about their current state or plans, which would require real-time information about their location, scheduled events, or travel plans.

          To answer this question, I would need to:
          1. Check their calendar for today's events to see if they have any appointments or activities
          2. Check the weather (though this might not directly answer the question)
          3. Possibly check their location or travel status

          Looking at the available tools, I have:
          - `calendar_get_events` - to check calendar events for "today"
          - `GetDateTime` - to get current date/time (not really helpful for this question)
          - `GetLiveContext` - to get real-time information about devices/sensors

          The most relevant tool here would be `calendar_get_events` with range "today" to see if they have any events today that would indicate they're leaving the house. Let me check their calendar for today.

          I should call `calendar_get_events` with calendar "Personal" and range "today" to see if there are any events scheduled.

          **Dinner with Liza** at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill - 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM

          You also have a Chemistry class at 11:00 AM, but no location is specified for that.

          So yes, you are likely leaving the house today for your dinner with Liza!
        thinking_content: |-
          Looking at the calendar results, I can see there are two events today:
          1. Chemistry class at 11:00 AM - no location specified
          2. Dinner with Liza at 19:00 (7:00 PM) at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill

          The chemistry class doesn't have a location specified, so I can't tell if it's a "leaving the house" activity. However, the dinner with Liza is at a restaurant called "Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill" which suggests it's a trip to a restaurant, which would typically involve leaving the house.

          I should present this information to the user and let them know about the dinner appointment that likely involves leaving the house.
