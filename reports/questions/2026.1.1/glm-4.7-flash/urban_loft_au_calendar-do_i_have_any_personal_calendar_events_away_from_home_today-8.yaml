response: |-
  I can see your calendar for today (Wednesday, April 2nd). You have two personal events:

  1. **Chemistry class** - 11:00 AM to 11:55 AM (no location specified)
  2. **Dinner with Liza** - 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill

  Based on the location information available, the **Dinner with Liza** event appears to be away from home since it's at a specific restaurant. However, I can't definitively identify which events are "away from home" versus "at home" because the calendar system doesn't provide location data for all events.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          I can see your calendar for today (Wednesday, April 2nd). You have two personal events:

          1. **Chemistry class** - 11:00 AM to 11:55 AM (no location specified)
          2. **Dinner with Liza** - 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill

          Based on the location information available, the **Dinner with Liza** event appears to be away from home since it's at a specific restaurant. However, I can't definitively identify which events are "away from home" versus "at home" because the calendar system doesn't provide location data for all events.

          I can see the calendar events for today. Looking at the events:

          1. Chemistry class - 11:00 to 11:55, location: "None"
          2. Dinner with Liza - 19:00 to 20:30, location: "Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill"

          The second event (Dinner with Liza) has a specific location, which indicates it's likely away from home. The first event doesn't have a location specified.

          Since the calendar system doesn't provide location data for all events, I can't definitively say which events are "away from home" versus "at home". However, I can tell the user what events they have today and note that the Dinner with Liza event appears to be at a specific location (Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill), which suggests it's away from home.

          I should provide this information to the user and mention that the calendar system doesn't provide location data for all events, so I can't definitively identify which events are away from home.
