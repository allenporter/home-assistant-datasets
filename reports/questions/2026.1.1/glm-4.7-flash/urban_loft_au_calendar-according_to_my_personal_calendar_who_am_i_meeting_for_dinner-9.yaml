          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user is asking about their personal calendar to see who they're meeting for dinner. I need to use the calendar_get_events function to get the events from their calendar.

          Looking at the available functions, I can see:
          - calendar_get_events: "Get events from a calendar. When asked if something happens, search the whole week. Results are RFC 5545 which means 'end' is exclusive."

          The function requires:
          - calendar: "Personal" (this is the only option available)
          - range: "today" or "week" - since they're asking about dinner, I should probably get the week to be comprehensive

          Let me call the calendar function for "Personal" calendar with the "week" range to see all their scheduled events.

          Great! I can see the events from the user's Personal calendar. Looking at the results, I can see there's an event called "Dinner with Liza" scheduled for:

          - Start: 2025-04-02T19:00:00+10:00 (April 2nd, 2025 at 7:00 PM)
          - End: 2025-04-02T20:30:00+10:00 (April 2nd, 2025 at 8:30 PM)
          - Location: Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill
          - Description includes "Don't forget to bring flowers"

          This is clearly a dinner meeting with Liza, so I can answer the user's question directly.
