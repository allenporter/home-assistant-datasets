  I'd need more context to help you with that question. Are you asking about:

  - Someone in your personal contacts?
  - A specific business or service?
  - Emergency services?
  - Or something else entirely?

  Could you provide more details about who you're looking to contact and why?

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user is asking "Who do I need to call?" but this is a very vague question. It could mean:

          1. Someone they know personally
          2. A business or service
          3. Some kind of official contact

          Since this doesn't seem to relate to their home, devices, or current state, and they're asking about "who" in a general sense, this is a question that requires general knowledge rather than specific home assistant context.

          However, I don't have specific information about who they might need to call based on the context provided. The tools I have available are focused on controlling smart home devices, checking the current state of their home, managing tasks, and getting calendar events - none of which would help answer who they need to call.

          I should ask for clarification about what they're looking for, since I cannot make assumptions about who they need to contact without more context.
