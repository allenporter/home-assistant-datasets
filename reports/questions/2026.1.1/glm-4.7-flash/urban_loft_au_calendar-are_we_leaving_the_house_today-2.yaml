          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user is asking if they're leaving the house today. This is asking about current status/conditions of the home. According to my instructions, I need to use the `GetLiveContext` tool for this type of question since it requires real-time information about the current state of devices or conditions.

          Let me call GetLiveContext to get the current state of the home.

          The live context shows:
          - All lights are off (balcony, bedroom, kitchen, living room, terrace)
          - Motion sensor on the rooftop terrace is ON
          - Samsung TV is playing in the living room
          - Smart plugs are off
          - Weather is sunny with 22.2°C and 60% humidity

          Based on the motion sensor being on, it suggests there's recent movement in the rooftop terrace area. However, I don't have specific information about whether anyone is currently leaving the house or has left. The motion sensor being on could indicate recent activity, but doesn't tell me if the person is leaving right now or has left.

          I should ask the user for more clarification or context about what they're seeing or trying to determine.
