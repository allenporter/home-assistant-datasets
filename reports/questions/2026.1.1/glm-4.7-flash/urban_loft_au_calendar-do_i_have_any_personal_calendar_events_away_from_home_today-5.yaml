  Yes, you have one calendar event today that's away from home:

  **Dinner with Liza** at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill
  - Time: 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM

  I also see you have a Chemistry class at 11:00 AM, but since there's no location specified, I can't determine if that one is away from home or at your school/location.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user is asking if they have any personal calendar events away from home today. I need to check their calendar for today.

          Looking at the available functions, I can see there's a `calendar_get_events` function that can get events from a calendar. It takes a "calendar" parameter which can be "Personal" and a "range" parameter which can be "today" or "week".

          Since the user is asking about today's events, I should use "today" as the range and "Personal" as the calendar name.

          Let me call this function to get their calendar events for today.

          Yes, you have one calendar event today that's away from home:

          **Dinner with Liza** at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill
          - Time: 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM

          I also see you have a Chemistry class at 11:00 AM, but since there's no location specified, I can't determine if that one is away from home or at your school/location.
        thinking_content: |-
          Looking at the calendar events for today, I can see:

          1. Chemistry class at 11:00 AM - location: "None" (which likely means at home or the school location isn't specified)
          2. Dinner with Liza at 7:00 PM - location: "Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill" (this is away from home)

          The second event "Dinner with Liza" at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill is definitely away from home. The first event doesn't have a specified location, so I can't determine if it's away from home or not.

          I should inform the user about the event that is clearly away from home.
