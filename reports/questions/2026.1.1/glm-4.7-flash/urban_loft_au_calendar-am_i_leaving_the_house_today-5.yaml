          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user is asking if they are leaving the house today. To answer this accurately, I need to check their calendar for today to see if they have any events scheduled. I should use the calendar_get_events function with the "today" range and the "Personal" calendar to see if there are any events that would indicate they're leaving the house.

          Let me check their calendar for today.

            summary: Dinner with Liza
            description: Meet up with Liza, don't forget to bring flowers
            location: Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill
        created: 2026-01-27 16:03:59.040240+00:00
      - role: assistant
        agent_id: conversation.mock_title
        content: Based on your calendar for today, you do have plans that involve
          leaving the house. You have a dinner with Liza at 7:00 PM at Peninsula CR
          Steak & Seafood Grill, which means you'll be going out for the evening.
        thinking_content: |-
          Looking at the calendar events for today (April 2, 2025), I can see:

          1. Chemistry class at 11:00 AM - This doesn't seem to be related to leaving the house
          2. Dinner with Liza at 7:00 PM at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill - This appears to be going out to dinner, which would involve leaving the house

          Since there's an event at 7:00 PM that involves going out to dinner, this suggests the user will be leaving the house today. However, I should be careful not to assume - I should present this information factually and let the user decide if that counts as "leaving the house."

          Actually, let me think about this more carefully. The user asked "Am I leaving the house today?" - this is asking about their current plans or intention to leave. Looking at the events:

          - 11:00 AM: Chemistry class - This could be at home or away
          - 7:00 PM: Dinner with Liza - This is definitely leaving the house

          So yes, there's an event that clearly involves leaving the house (the dinner).
