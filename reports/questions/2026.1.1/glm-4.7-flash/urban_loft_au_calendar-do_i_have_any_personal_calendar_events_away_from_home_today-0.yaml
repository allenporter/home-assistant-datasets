          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user is asking about personal calendar events away from home today. I need to check their calendar for today's events.

          Looking at the available functions, I can see there's a `calendar_get_events` function that can get events from a calendar. The parameters are:
          - calendar: "Personal" (this seems to be the only option available)
          - range: "today" (this matches what the user is asking for)

          Let me call this function to get the events for today.

          Yes, you have one personal calendar event today that's away from home:

          - **Dinner with Liza** at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM)

          The other event, "Chemistry class," is at home with no specified location.
        thinking_content: |-
          I can see the calendar events for today. Looking at the results:

          1. "Chemistry class" from 11:00 to 11:55 with location "None" (so this is at home)
          2. "Dinner with Liza" from 19:00 to 20:30 with location "Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill" (this is away from home)

          So yes, there is one personal calendar event today that is away from home - the "Dinner with Liza" event.
