  Yes, you have one personal calendar event today that appears to be away from home:

  **Dinner with Liza** - 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill

  There's also a **Chemistry class** at 11:00 AM, but its location isn't specified, so I can't determine if that's away from home or at your usual location.

  So you have 1 definite event away from home today - the dinner with Liza.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: |-
          The user is asking about personal calendar events away from home today. They're asking if there are any personal calendar events that would involve them being away from home.

          Looking at the available functions, I can see there's a `calendar_get_events` function that can get events from a calendar. Let me check what parameters it needs:

          - calendar: "Personal" (there's only one option)
          - range: "today" (which matches what the user is asking for)

          The function description says "Get events from a calendar. When asked if something happens, search the whole week. Results are RFC 5545 which means 'end' is exclusive."

          So I can call this function with calendar="Personal" and range="today" to get the events. The user asked about today, so "today" is the appropriate range.

          However, the function doesn't seem to have parameters to specify whether an event is "away from home" or not. It just returns the events from the calendar. I'll need to call it and then interpret the results - I can't determine from the event details whether they're away from home just by looking at the event data returned by the function.

          Let me call the function first and see what events are available.

          Yes, you have one personal calendar event today that appears to be away from home:

          **Dinner with Liza** - 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill

          There's also a **Chemistry class** at 11:00 AM, but its location isn't specified, so I can't determine if that's away from home or at your usual location.

          So you have 1 definite event away from home today - the dinner with Liza.
        thinking_content: |-
          I can see there are two personal calendar events for today:

          1. Chemistry class from 11:00 AM to 11:55 AM - no location specified, so this might be at home or somewhere else
          2. Dinner with Liza from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM at Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill - this has a specific location, so this would be away from home

          The user asked about events away from home. Based on the results:
          - The Chemistry class doesn't have a location specified, so I can't determine if it's away from home
          - The Dinner with Liza has a specific location (Peninsula CR Steak & Seafood Grill), so that would definitely be away from home

          I should inform the user about both events but clarify that the Chemistry class location isn't specified, while the dinner is definitely away from home.
