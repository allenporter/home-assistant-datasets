          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user: "Unlock all the doors". We need to unlock all locks. There are lock devices:

          - Garage Door Opener? Wait domain cover. There's "Garage Door Opener" but domain cover not lock. It's cover, not lock. So not to unlock.

          - "Rear Door Lock" domain lock, area Garage.

          - "Smart Lock" domain lock, area Entry.

          So two locks. Unlock all doors: unlock these two. Use HassTurnOff for locks? Wait instructions: Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. Because lock is considered turning off? That seems counterintuitive but given instruction: For locks, use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock. So unlocking -> HassTurnOff.

          We should call HassTurnOff for each lock. Provide name and domain? They say prefer passing just name and domain. For each lock: name: "Rear Door Lock", domain: lock. name: "Smart Lock", domain: lock. area: maybe but not needed.

          We might also want to ask for confirmation? But the instruction: If user asks to unlock all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type. There are two locks. We might need to ask to specify area? But we have two. They want unlock all. We can do that automatically. It didn't ask for area. But there are two. We can proceed.

          So we need to call HassTurnOff twice. Probably combine or do separate calls. We'll do two calls.

          But tool signature: HassTurnOff expects area, device_class, domain, floor, name. We need to provide name and domain. The device_class and floor can be omitted? They say pass just name and domain. So we can pass name: string, domain: array? The domain param expects any[]. Provide ["lock"] maybe. area: string. But we can skip? It might require a field. Let's inspect signature:

          type HassTurnOff = (_: {
            area: string,
            device_class: any[],
            domain: any[],
            floor: string,
            name: string,
          }) => any;

          We need to provide all fields? They say prefer passing just name and domain. But the function signature requires them. We can supply area optional? Not sure. Might need to fill them. We'll set area as the area of the lock. Provide domain as ["lock"]. device_class: [] maybe. floor: empty string.

          So two calls:

          HassTurnOff for "Rear Door Lock" in area "Garage", domain ["lock"].

          HassTurnOff for "Smart Lock" in area "Entry", domain ["lock"].

          Let's do that.
