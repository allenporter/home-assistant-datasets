          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user says: "Stop Roborock Downstairs". That is a command to stop the vacuum. According to the instruction: use HassStopMoving? Wait, the tool set includes "HassVacuumStart" and "HassVacuumReturnToBase". There's also "HassStopMoving" but it's for moving devices. For vacuum, I think the correct tool is likely "HassVacuumStart" and "HassVacuumReturnToBase". But there's no tool for stopping a vacuum. "HassStopMoving" is general for moving device or entity. That might be used for vacuum too. But the instruction says "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain." So we should call HassStopMoving? But let's read the tool definitions: "HassStopMoving" has domain: any[], name, area, device_class, floor. The vacuum is a device, domain: vacuum. So we should call HassStopMoving with name: "Roborock Downstairs", domain: ["vacuum"], area: "Living Room" (since it's in living room). But maybe the vacuum entity name is "Roborock Downstairs". Yes, static context: names: Roborock Downstairs domain: vacuum areas: Living Room.

          We can also do HassVacuumReturnToBase? That might be appropriate. But the user specifically said "Stop Roborock Downstairs". That likely means stop moving. So we should call HassStopMoving. The instruction: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." So name: Roborock Downstairs, domain: vacuum. Provide area? The instruction says "When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain." We are controlling a device, not an area. So pass name, domain. Probably area optional but we can include area. But I'll follow the instruction: pass name and domain. But tool signature includes area, device_class, domain, floor. Maybe we need to provide those. But we can set area empty? No. It likely expects values. We can provide area: Living Room, domain: ["vacuum"], name: Roborock Downstairs.

          Thus call HassStopMoving with area: "Living Room", domain: ["vacuum"], name: "Roborock Downstairs".

          We also could call HassVacuumStart? No. So let's call HassStopMoving.

          We need to respond with plain text after the tool call? Actually we call the tool, no response content needed? The assistant should call the tool. So final output: call the tool.

          The tool doesn't support vacuum for HassStopMoving? Maybe we should use HassVacuumReturnToBase? That is for vacuum. The instruction didn't mention that tool for stopping. But likely we should use HassVacuumReturnToBase to stop. But the user said stop. The best approach: use HassVacuumReturnToBase to send the vacuum home, which stops it. Let's try that.

          HassVacuumReturnToBase requires area, domain, floor, name. Domain: vacuum. Floor not provided but we can omit? It's required. Maybe we need to pass floor: empty string? Hard. We could call HassVacuumStart? No.

          We have no tool to stop a vacuum directly. The instructions mention "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." For vacuum, the only tools are Start and ReturnToBase. There's no stop. So "Stop" maybe means return to base. So we should call HassVacuumReturnToBase. Let's do that.

          Call HassVacuumReturnToBase with area: "Living Room", domain: ["vacuum"], name: "Roborock Downstairs". Floor maybe omitted but let's pass floor: ""? Let's see signature: floor: string. So pass floor: "" or null? Provide "".

          Let's call that.
