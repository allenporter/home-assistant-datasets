          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          User wants to "Shut off the upstairs lights". Need to determine upstairs lights. Which areas considered upstairs? We have Bedroom 1, 2, 3, 4, Kitchen, Living Room, Dining Room, etc. "Upstairs" likely includes Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2, Bedroom 3, Bedroom 4, Living Room, Dining Room. Also possibly Kitchen? Kitchen likely downstairs. So we have 5 rooms upstairs: Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2, Bedroom 3, Bedroom 4, Living Room, Dining Room. That's 6 actually: Living Room and Dining Room. So 6 lights: Bedroom 1 Light, Bedroom 2 Light, Bedroom 3 Light, Bedroom 4 Light, Living Room Light, Dining Room Light. So need to turn off all lights in these areas. The instruction: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain." For multiple devices, we can call HassTurnOff for each name. The user says "Shut off the upstairs lights please." We should call HassTurnOff for each of these 6 lights. Provide concise confirmation after. Let's see: We can batch? The function takes name and domain only, but we could send multiple? Probably one call per light. So need to call 6 times. Or maybe can use area name and domain to turn off all lights in area. But there are multiple areas. The instruction: "When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain." So we could call HassTurnOff for each area: "Bedroom 1" domain "light", etc. That would turn off all lights in that area. So we need 6 calls: Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2, Bedroom 3, Bedroom 4, Living Room, Dining Room. Domain is light. So we call 6 times. After calls, we can respond "All upstairs lights have been turned off." Probably good.

          We need to use the tool. So produce 6 function calls.
