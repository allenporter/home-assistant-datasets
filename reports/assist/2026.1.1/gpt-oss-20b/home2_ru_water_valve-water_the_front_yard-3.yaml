          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          User wants to water the front yard. That implies turning on Irrigation Valve. We should check if there's only one device of that type. The static context has Irrigation Valve in Front yard. There's only one irrigation valve? We see "Irrigation Valve" domain valve, areas Front yard. There's only one. So we can turn it on. According to instruction: When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. So we use HassTurnOn with name: Irrigation Valve, domain: valve. But we must specify device or domain? The tool HassTurnOn: parameters: area, device_class, domain, floor, name. We can use domain: valve, name: Irrigation Valve. But domain is array? The type shows domain: any[]. So pass array ["valve"] maybe? But instructions say prefer passing just name and domain. But domain must be an array? It's any[]. Probably we give domain: ['valve'].

          We can call HassTurnOn with area: "Front yard" or not. The instruction says for controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. But we should still pass area? It's optional. Let's pass name and domain only. So area omitted? The tool signature has all keys required? Might be optional but not sure. We might pass name, domain. But to be safe, include area too: area: "Front yard", domain: ["valve"], name: "Irrigation Valve". That's fine.

          Let's produce a concise answer: "Sure, watering the front yard now." And call HassTurnOn.
