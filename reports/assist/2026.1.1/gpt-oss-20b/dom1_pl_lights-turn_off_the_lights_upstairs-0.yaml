          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          User: "Turn off the lights upstairs". We need to interpret "upstairs" meaning which areas are upstairs? The static context lists areas: Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2, Bedroom 3, Bedroom 4, Kitchen, Dining Room, Garage, Backyard, Living Room. Which are upstairs? Likely Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2, Bedroom 3, Bedroom 4, Dining Room? Not sure. The question: "turn off the lights upstairs". Usually upstairs includes bedrooms and possibly dining room. In the list, "Living Room" and "Kitchen" might be downstairs. So "lights upstairs" would be Bedroom 1 Light, Bedroom 2 Light, Bedroom 3 Light, Bedroom 4 Light, Dining Room Light? Also maybe there is no other lights upstairs. The user wants to turn off all lights upstairs. According to instruction: "When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type." But here it's "turn off the lights upstairs" which is not all devices of a specific type globally. It's a group. We should interpret that as turn off all lights in areas that are upstairs. We need to call HassTurnOff for each relevant light. Should we ask for clarification? The instruction: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain." So we could send HassTurnOff for each area, domain light? That might turn off all lights in that area. But we have separate lights in each bedroom and dining room. We could send HassTurnOff for area "Bedroom 1" domain light, same for Bedroom 2, Bedroom 3, Bedroom 4, Dining Room. But "turn off the lights upstairs" likely means all lights in upstairs areas: the bedrooms and dining room. So we should send multiple HassTurnOff calls. The instruction: "When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain." So call HassTurnOff with area and domain? Let's check the function signature for HassTurnOff:

          ```
          type HassTurnOff = (_: {
            area: string,
            device_class: any[],
            domain: any[],
            floor: string,
            name: string,
          }) => any;
          ```

          We need to pass domain, area, name, maybe floor. The static context doesn't provide floor. But we can set floor empty or null. But instructions say prefer passing just name and domain. That suggests maybe we can pass only name and domain. But function signature requires more. There's no optional fields? But we can pass null for optional ones. We'll supply domain: ["light"], area: "", name: the light's name? We could specify name: "Bedroom 1 Light". That should turn off that specific light. We need to do for each: Bedroom 1 Light, Bedroom 2 Light, Bedroom 3 Light, Bedroom 4 Light, Dining Room Light. So we should call HassTurnOff five times. The instruction says to use the intent tools. So we will do that. There's no mention of floor, device_class. We'll supply empty arrays for device_class and domain as arrays? It says domain: any[]. Provide "light". Let's provide domain: ["light"]. device_class: [] maybe. name: "Bedroom 1 Light". area: "Bedroom 1". For Dining Room: area "Dining Room". So do five calls.
