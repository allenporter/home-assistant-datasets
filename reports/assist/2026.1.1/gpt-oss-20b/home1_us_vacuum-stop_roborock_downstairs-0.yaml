          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          We need to issue a command to stop moving a vacuum. That is HassStopMoving. According to instructions, "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." So we provide name: "Roborock Downstairs", domain: "vacuum". Also need area? The tool definition includes area optional. Let's check HassStopMoving signature: area: string, device_class, domain, floor, name. The question says "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain." So we should include name and domain only. But the tool's required parameters? Let's see the tool definition: type HassStopMoving = (_: { area: string, device_class: any[], domain: any[], floor: string, name: string, }) => any;

          All fields are required? Probably optional? But typical. But we can pass name and domain only? But schema requires area? But instruction says prefer passing just name and domain. We may omit area if not required. However the tool signature indicates required keys, but maybe optional. Let's attempt passing name and domain only. Also device_class and floor can be omitted. Let's call the tool.

          Maybe tool expects domain name "vacuum" as string? But signature: domain: any[]. Actually the function definitions may be wrong? For HassStopMoving, domain: any[]. Should be array. But still not recognized? Might be mis-specified. Maybe we should call HassVacuumStop? There's no such tool. Wait maybe the correct function for stopping a vacuum is HassVacuumStop? Not listed. There's HassVacuumStart and HassVacuumReturnToBase. But to stop moving, maybe HassStopMoving is used for any moving device like vacuum or car. But error says domain not supported: vacuum. Maybe the domain must be "vacuum" but tool expects domain: any[]? Maybe we must provide device_class or domain as something else? Let's inspect the tool: HassStopMoving = (_: { area: string, device_class: any[], domain: any[], floor: string, name: string, }) => any;

          Maybe "domain" expects "cover" etc? Not sure.

          Alternatively we might use HassVacuumReturnToBase? That returns to base, which stops. But user wants to stop, so maybe "vacuum stop" is equivalent to "return to base". But question: "Stop Roborock Downstairs". Likely want to stop cleaning. The proper function maybe "HassVacuumStop"? But not available.

          We can attempt to call HassVacuumReturnToBase to stop. Let's try that.
