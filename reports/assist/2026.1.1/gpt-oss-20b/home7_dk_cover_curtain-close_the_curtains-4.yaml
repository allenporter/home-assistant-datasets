          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          User wants to close the curtains. We need to turn off or set cover to closed. Domain: cover, name: Smart Curtain. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. But for cover, we need to use HassSetPosition or maybe HassTurnOff? The instruction: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." So we should use HassTurnOff? Actually cover device: we can use HassSetPosition or HassTurnOff? For cover, likely we need HassSetPosition with position: 0 or 100. But the tool doesn't have a set position for cover? There's HassSetPosition tool. So we can call HassSetPosition with name: Smart Curtain, domain: cover, position: 0 (closed). According to instructions: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." So we should pass name, domain. But we also need area? It says prefer passing just name and domain. So maybe we should just pass name and domain, but tool signature requires area and domain and other fields. We need to fill in domain: ["cover"], name: "Smart Curtain". We also need area: not required? It says prefer passing just name and domain. So maybe omit area. But the tool signature requires area, domain, name. It probably doesn't require area? It says type HassSetPosition = (_: { area: string, device_class: any[], domain: any[], floor: string, name: string, position: number, }) => any; So area and floor may be optional? It says "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." That means we can just give name and domain, but other fields optional? We'll try to give minimal: name, domain, position. We need to provide area? Not sure. Let's give domain: ["cover"], name: "Smart Curtain", position: 0. Provide maybe no area. But signature shows area string mandatory. We can set area: ""? We can set area: "Living Room" since the curtain is in Living Room. Provide floor maybe empty. Provide device_class maybe empty. We'll use: area: "Living Room", domain: ["cover"], name: "Smart Curtain", position: 0. Floor: "".

          Thus call HassSetPosition with those.
