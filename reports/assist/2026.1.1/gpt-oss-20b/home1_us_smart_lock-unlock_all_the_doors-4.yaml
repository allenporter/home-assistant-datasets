          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          User: "Unlock all the doors". We need to unlock all lock entities. Which lock entities? Looking at static context: "Rear Door Lock" (domain lock, area Garage). "Smart Lock" (domain lock, area Entry). Possibly others? Those are lock devices. "Garage Door Opener" domain cover, but lock domain? "Garage Door Opener" has domain cover, not lock. There's also "Garage Door Opener" domain light? But lock? No. So two lock entities: Rear Door Lock, Smart Lock. The user wants to unlock all doors. We need to unlock both. According to instructions: Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock. Wait: In the instructions, "Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock." That's reversed? Let's parse: "When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock." That is weird: Usually lock is 'lock' command. But they instruct to use HassTurnOn to lock. So we need to send HassTurnOff to unlock. So we call HassTurnOff twice: one for Rear Door Lock, one for Smart Lock. But we should combine? Tools may allow multiple entities? The tool signature expects one name and domain. Probably we need two calls. The assistant should call tool twice. In the response to user, we should likely say "Unlocking all doors." But the system might want us to call the tools. As a voice assistant, we call the tool. We can output the tool calls. Let's call HassTurnOff for Rear Door Lock and Smart Lock.

          We must also check that we should mention area. The tool signature includes area, domain, name. We can pass area and domain. The instruction says: When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. So we can pass domain lock, name "Rear Door Lock". area? Probably optional. The signature shows domain: any[], area: string, name: string. But we can pass domain: ["lock"]? The domain might be "lock". Let's check signature: HassTurnOff(_: { area: string, device_class: any[], domain: any[], floor: string, name: string }). We can supply domain: "lock" and name. No need to specify area maybe. But we can pass "Rear Door Lock". For second, "Smart Lock". Let's call with domain "lock". The instructions: prefer passing just name and domain. So we can pass domain: "lock", name: "Rear Door Lock". So let's do two calls. We'll output the tool calls.

          We need to decide ordering: maybe "Rear Door Lock" first, then "Smart Lock".

          We need to output JSON calls? The tool usage format: Use the function name with arguments. So something like:

          ```json
          {
            "name": "HassTurnOff",
            "arguments": {
              "domain": ["lock"],
              "name": "Rear Door Lock"
            }
          }
          ```

          But according to instructions, we just call tool. The output format: call the intent tools. I think we produce a JSON call for each.

          We should not output anything else? The system might want the assistant to respond to user after executing tools. But typical pattern: we output tool calls, then system may return results. The user hasn't asked any follow-up. So we call the tool, then produce a short message? Probably just call the tools. The system might handle them. In our response, we should output the tool calls. In the final message, we might want to say "Unlocking all doors." or not? The instructions: "When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools." So we must call the tools. Possibly we can respond after tool execution? But we don't know the result. We'll just call the tools. That should satisfy. We'll also output nothing else. We'll use separate calls.

          Let's output two calls.
