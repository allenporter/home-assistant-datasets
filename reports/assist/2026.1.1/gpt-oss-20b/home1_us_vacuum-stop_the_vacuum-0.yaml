          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          domain but maybe the tool expects something else? The error suggests vacuum
          not supported. Might be that we cannot use HassStopMoving for vacuum. But
          maybe there''s a tool HassVacuumStart and HassVacuumReturnToBase. There
          isn''t a stop tool for vacuum. So how to stop? Possibly we need to send

          user says "Stop the vacuum". Perhaps the vacuum can be paused? There''s
          no HassVacuumPause. Maybe we can send a HassVacuumReturnToBase. That stops
          it. So we can do HassVacuumReturnToBase with area "Living Room" name "Roborock
          Downstairs". That will send it to base, effectively stopping. So we need
          to call HassVacuumReturnToBase. Use area: Living Room, name: Roborock Downstairs,
