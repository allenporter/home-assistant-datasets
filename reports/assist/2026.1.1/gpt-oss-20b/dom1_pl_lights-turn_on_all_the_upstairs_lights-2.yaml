          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: |-
          The user says: "Turn on all the upstairs lights". We need to understand that "upstairs" refers to maybe the bedroom areas: Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2, Bedroom 3, Bedroom 4, maybe Living Room? The static context shows the lights:

          - Bedroom 1 Light in Bedroom 1
          - Bedroom 2 Light in Bedroom 2
          - Bedroom 3 Light in Bedroom 3
          - Bedroom 4 Light in Bedroom 4
          - Dining Room Light in Dining Room
          - Garage Camera Motion etc not lights
          - Garden Light in Backyard
          - Kitchen Light in Kitchen
          - Living Room Light in Living Room
          - etc.

          Upstairs might include Bedrooms and Living Room? The user asks to turn on all the upstairs lights. We need to see if there's only one type of light upstairs? There's multiple lights. According to instruction: "When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type." Here the user didn't specify area; we have multiple devices of type light upstairs. We should ask user to specify an area? But the instruction says: "When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type." So we should ask which area. The user said "upstairs" which is ambiguous. We could interpret "upstairs" as all lights in areas with "Bedroom" and "Living Room" perhaps. But we could also ask for clarification: "Which upstairs area would you like to turn on the lights?" But maybe we can interpret upstairs includes Bedroom 1-4 and Living Room? We can ask for clarification: "Which area upstairs would you like to turn on the lights?" Or we could turn on all lights in all upstairs areas by issuing separate HassTurnOn calls for each light name. But the instruction says to ask user to specify area. But we can interpret that "upstairs" is the user-specified area. There's no explicit area named "Upstairs". So better ask for clarification: "Which upstairs area would you like to turn on the lights?" But maybe we can answer that we need clarification. The user specifically says "Turn on all the upstairs lights". If we interpret that as all lights in all areas that are upstairs: Bedroom 1, 2, 3, 4, Living Room. That would be multiple devices, so we should ask the user to specify area? The instruction: "When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type." There are multiple devices. So we should ask which area. The user didn't specify "upstairs" but the context of the house is presumably a multi-story home. We can interpret "upstairs" as the upper floor. The user is asking to turn on all the upstairs lights. According to instruction, we should ask which area. But maybe the user is fine with turning on all upstairs lights, and we can proceed. But instruction says to ask. So I should ask: "Which upstairs area would you like to turn on the lights? For example, Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2, Living Room?" I think best to ask for clarification.
