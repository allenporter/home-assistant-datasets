          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: "We need to perform two actions: turn on Kitchen Light and\
          \ turn off Living Room Light. We should use HassTurnOn and HassTurnOff.\
          \ The instruction says: use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock\
          \ a lock. Actually that seems contradictory: the instruction says: \"When\
          \ controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn\
          \ to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer\
          \ passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing\
          \ just area name and domain.\" But that seems a mistake: HassTurnOn should\
          \ turn on a device, HassTurnOff to turn off. The text \"Use HassTurnOn to\
          \ lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock\" is wrong; maybe they swapped?\
          \ Let's read: \"When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools.\
          \ Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock.\" That seems\
          \ wrong. But we must obey instruction. But turning on a light is not a lock.\
          \ The earlier lines: \"Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock\
          \ a lock.\" But that is contradictory to what we want: we want to turn on\
          \ the kitchen light. So we need to use HassTurnOn with name \"Kitchen Light\"\
          \ domain \"light\". And HassTurnOff with name \"Living Room Light\" domain\
          \ \"light\". That should be correct.\n\nWe also need to call them sequentially:\
          \ turn on kitchen light then turn off living room light. There's no dependency.\
          \ We'll produce two function calls.\n\nBut we should consider if we need\
          \ to confirm that these devices exist. They do exist in static context.\n\
          \nWe need to pass name and domain. Domain is \"light\".\n\nThus:\n\nHassTurnOn\
          \ with name=\"Kitchen Light\", domain=[\"light\"]? The signature: HassTurnOn\
          \ takes { area, device_class, domain, floor, name }. Domain is an array.\
          \ We can set domain: [\"light\"]. We can leave area blank. But instruction:\
          \ When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. So we\
          \ can pass name and domain.\n\nSimilarly for HassTurnOff.\n\nWe should use\
          \ tool calls. The assistant should first turn on kitchen light, then turn\
          \ off living room light. We'll produce two calls in order.\n\nWe might need\
          \ to wrap calls: first call HassTurnOn, then HassTurnOff. Since tool calls\
          \ are separate, we can produce sequential calls.\n\nThus output:\n\nFirst\
          \ call to HassTurnOn: { name: \"Kitchen Light\", domain: [\"light\"] }\n\
          \nSecond call to HassTurnOff: { name: \"Living Room Light\", domain: [\"\
          light\"] }\n\nWe should also respond to user. The instructions: \"When controlling\
          \ Home Assistant always call the intent tools.\" So we should not produce\
          \ textual answer but the tool calls. But typically we produce both textual\
          \ and calls. The guidelines not explicit. But in earlier interactions, we\
          \ just call the tools.\n\nThus we should produce:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\"\
          : \"Kitchen Light\",\n  \"domain\": [\"light\"]\n}\n```\nBut tool requires\
          \ function call structure: We need to call the tool functions. We produce\
          \ a tool invocation. So the assistant will produce:\n\nAssistant: \n```json\n\
          {\n  \"name\": \"Kitchen Light\",\n  \"domain\": [\"light\"]\n}\n```\nBut\
          \ that's not correct: The tool function name is HassTurnOn. We need to call\
          \ the function with arguments. So we produce a function call: \"name\":\
          \ \"HassTurnOn\", \"arguments\": {...}.\n\nIn previous tasks, we provide\
          \ function calls like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"HassTurnOn\",\n  \"\
          arguments\": {\n    \"name\": \"Kitchen Light\",\n    \"domain\": [\"light\"\
          ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut we might also need to include other fields like area,\
          \ device_class, floor. They can be omitted. The tool signature: ( { area:\
          \ string, device_class: any[], domain: any[], floor: string, name: string\
          \ } ). We can just supply name and domain, leaving others optional. Let's\
          \ produce:\n\nFirst call: HassTurnOn with name \"Kitchen Light\" domain\
          \ [\"light\"].\n\nSecond call: HassTurnOff with name \"Living Room Light\"\
          \ domain [\"light\"].\n\nWe'll output them sequentially.\n\nWe might need\
          \ to separate calls by newline.\n\nSo the assistant output:\n\n```\n{\n\
          \  \"name\": \"HassTurnOn\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"name\": \"Kitchen\
          \ Light\",\n    \"domain\": [\"light\"]\n  }\n}\n{\n  \"name\": \"HassTurnOff\"\
          ,\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"name\": \"Living Room Light\",\n    \"domain\"\
          : [\"light\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut the system expects a single tool call?\
          \ Usually we can produce multiple calls? We can call them sequentially.\
          \ The environment may accept multiple calls. But we may produce them sequentially.\n\
          \nGiven guidelines: \"When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent\
          \ tools.\" We might do two calls. We'll provide them as separate lines.\n\
          \nThus final answer."
