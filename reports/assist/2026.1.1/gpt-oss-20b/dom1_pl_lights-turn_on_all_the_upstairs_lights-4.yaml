          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: "The user says: \"Turn on all the upstairs lights\". We\
          \ need to figure which areas are upstairs. The static context includes:\
          \ Bedroom 1, 2, 3, 4, Kitchen, Dining Room, Garage, Backyard, Living Room.\
          \ Which of these are upstairs? Usually, Bedroom 1-4 are upstairs. Also maybe\
          \ Kitchen? Not sure. But likely bedrooms are upstairs. Kitchen is typically\
          \ downstairs. Dining room likely downstairs. Living Room downstairs. So\
          \ upstairs lights: Bedroom 1 Light, Bedroom 2 Light, Bedroom 3 Light, Bedroom\
          \ 4 Light.\n\nThe instruction says: \"When controlling a device, prefer\
          \ passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing\
          \ just area name and domain. When a user asks to turn on all devices of\
          \ a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one\
          \ device of that type.\" So if user asks to turn on all the upstairs lights,\
          \ we have multiple devices. The instruction: \"When a user asks to turn\
          \ on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless\
          \ there is only one device of that type.\" But here they already specify\
          \ area: \"upstairs\". So we can turn on all upstairs lights. That means\
          \ we should call HassTurnOn for each light? The instructions say: \"When\
          \ controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain.\" So we need\
          \ to call HassTurnOn for each device: name: Bedroom 1 Light, domain: light;\
          \ same for Bedroom 2 Light etc.\n\nAlternatively, we could call HassTurnOn\
          \ for the area? But area-level? The tool expects domain: any[] but we can\
          \ pass just domain light? For area-level, prefer passing just area name\
          \ and domain. But the instruction says \"When controlling a device, prefer\
          \ passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing\
          \ just area name and domain.\" So controlling a device is each light. So\
          \ call HassTurnOn for each light. There are four lights upstairs. So we\
          \ should call HassTurnOn four times. Is that acceptable? The instruction\
          \ doesn't mention combining. So we do multiple calls. So we should produce\
          \ calls to HassTurnOn for each.\n\nBut do we need to use multiple calls\
          \ or single? The tool signature: HassTurnOn has parameters: area, device_class,\
          \ domain, floor, name. We can supply domain: e.g., [\"light\"]. We can pass\
          \ name. For area we can pass the area of that device. But we prefer passing\
          \ name and domain only. It says \"prefer passing just name and domain.\"\
          \ So we can pass name and domain. But the signature requires area? Possibly\
          \ optional. We can set area to \"\"? But the tool expects all fields. Let's\
          \ set name, domain. area empty string? Not sure.\n\nWe can just set name\
          \ and domain. Use domain as [\"light\"]. area could be blank or not provided?\
          \ The tool requires area string; we can set area as \"Bedroom 1\" etc.\n\
          \nThus calls:\n\n- HassTurnOn with area: \"Bedroom 1\", domain: [\"light\"\
          ], name: \"Bedroom 1 Light\".\n- HassTurnOn with area: \"Bedroom 2\", domain:\
          \ [\"light\"], name: \"Bedroom 2 Light\".\n- HassTurnOn with area: \"Bedroom\
          \ 3\", domain: [\"light\"], name: \"Bedroom 3 Light\".\n- HassTurnOn with\
          \ area: \"Bedroom 4\", domain: [\"light\"], name: \"Bedroom 4 Light\".\n\
          \nWe must format as tool calls. Output plain text? Actually we need to call\
          \ the tool. In the conversation, we should output the tool calls. The answer\
          \ can be plain text? The tool usage requires outputting JSON? Usually we\
          \ call the tool with tool invocation. The format: \n{\n \"name\": \"HassTurnOn\"\
          ,\n \"arguments\": { ... }\n}\nBut the instruction says: \"When controlling\
          \ Home Assistant always call the intent tools.\" So we need to call the\
          \ tool. We can do multiple calls. We should output the calls in separate\
          \ messages? Usually we can provide multiple tool calls in a single assistant\
          \ message? Might be multiple calls. We can output as separate messages?\
          \ The conversation may accept multiple calls.\n\nThus produce four tool\
          \ calls."
