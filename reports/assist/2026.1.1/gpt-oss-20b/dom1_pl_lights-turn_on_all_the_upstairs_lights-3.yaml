          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          User: "Turn on all the upstairs lights"

          We need to interpret "upstairs" area: Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2, Bedroom 3, Bedroom 4, Living Room? Actually Upstairs likely refers to bedrooms: Bedroom 1, 2, 3, 4, Living Room? Upstairs may include Living Room. But static context lists: Bedroom 1 Light, Bedroom 2 Light, Bedroom 3 Light, Bedroom 4 Light, Living Room Light. All are light domain.

          The instruction: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain." And "When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type." But here it's multiple devices of type light. It's asking to turn on all upstairs lights. That implies we should address each light individually or maybe we can use area. We have multiple devices in that area. There's no single area named "Upstairs". We have individual rooms.

          We need to turn on all lights in those rooms. So call HassTurnOn for each: Bedroom 1 Light, Bedroom 2 Light, Bedroom 3 Light, Bedroom 4 Light, Living Room Light.

          We can group? The tool requires separate calls? We can call once per device. We'll pass name and domain "light". Domain likely light. Provide area? We can pass name only and domain.

          We should call HassTurnOn for each with name and domain.

          Thus call multiple times. The assistant will send multiple calls? We can aggregate? The instructions: use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. For turning on lights, use HassTurnOn.

          We'll produce multiple calls: first with name "Bedroom 1 Light" domain ["light"], area optional. The tool signature: HassTurnOn expects fields: area: string, device_class: any[], domain: any[], floor: string, name: string. But instruction: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." But tool signature includes other fields. We can omit optional? Probably not. We should pass name, domain. area might be optional? It expects string, but maybe we can pass empty? We'll pass name and domain, other fields maybe omitted.

          Let's call with domain "light". domain is array? domain: any[]. So we pass ["light"]. area maybe not needed? We can leave area blank? The tool expects a string. Might require a value. But we can pass empty string. We'll pass area "".

          We'll call HassTurnOn for each light. Let's do sequential calls.

          We'll answer to user after calls: "Turning on all upstairs lights."
