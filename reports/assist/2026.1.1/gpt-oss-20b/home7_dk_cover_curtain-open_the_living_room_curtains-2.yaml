          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user wants to open the living room curtains. The device is "Smart Curtain" in domain cover. They want to "open" meaning set position to 100% or use turn_on? For covers, opening/closing typically is via turn_on? Actually for cover domain, actions like open/close are separate services: open_cover, close_cover. The instructions: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain." And "When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock." For curtains, it's a cover. We likely use HassTurnOn? But that may not be correct. But we have no function for cover. The instructions mention only specific functions: HassTurnOn and HassTurnOff are used for lock and others. There is no function for cover. However, the tool set does not include cover actions. But maybe we can use HassTurnOn? Possibly it's generic. But instructions: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." They didn't specify how to open a cover. Likely use HassTurnOn? But that might mean opening. But open is not lock/unlock. We could call HassTurnOn with domain cover? But domain is cover? The function HassTurnOn expects domain array but we only pass name and domain. So we can pass name: "Smart Curtain", domain: cover. But maybe better to call HassTurnOn with domain: cover. It may open the curtain. But I think open/close are separate services. But we don't have a tool for that. The best guess is to use HassTurnOn with domain: cover. That might open. Let's do that.

          We'll call HassTurnOn with name: "Smart Curtain", domain: ["cover"] or just "cover". The tool expects domain: any[]. Provide array ["cover"]. Also we need area? The instruction says prefer passing just name and domain. So we can pass only name and domain. So call HassTurnOn with name: "Smart Curtain", domain: ["cover"]. And maybe area: "Living Room". But prefer name and domain. But the function signature has area, domain, name. We can include area as "Living Room" for clarity but instructions prefer just name and domain. But let's pass name and domain. Ok.

          So:

          {
            name: "Smart Curtain",
            domain: ["cover"]
          }

          No area.

          Let's do it.
