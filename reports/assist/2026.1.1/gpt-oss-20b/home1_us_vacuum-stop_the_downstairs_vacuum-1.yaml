          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Not mandatory, but we can include area "Living Room" optionally. The instructions:

          we pass name and domain only. We''ll call function.'

          any[], domain?: any[], floor?: string, name: string }) => any. domain: any[]
          is accepted. But error says Domain not supported: vacuum. Maybe the tool
          expects domain to be list of supported domains? The domain "vacuum" may
          be unsupported. But the list shows vacuum device. Maybe the tool doesn''t
          have vacuum domain? In earlier list we have "vacuum" domain. So tool might
          support "vacuum" domain. But error indicates domain not supported. Maybe
          we need to use HassVacuumReturnToBase? No, that''s different. There''s no
          stop function for vacuum. For vacuum, maybe we should use HassVacuumReturnToBase?
          But the user wants to stop the vacuum, not return to base. There might not
          be a stop function; maybe the vacuum returns to base when stopped. But instructions:
          "Stops a moving device or entity" with HassStopMoving. It supports domains.
          But vacuum is a domain. So maybe the tool''s domain list includes "vacuum"?
          It says domain: any[]. But maybe we need to include domain name exactly
          as "vacuum". It''s already. But error says domain not supported: vacuum.
          Maybe the tool expects domain name in lowercase? It''s already lowercase.
          Could be the tool expects an array of domain names? It says domain?: any[]
          . So maybe we need to pass array of strings. We did that. So maybe the tool''s
          domain list is limited to certain domains, like ''light'', ''switch'', etc.,
          and vacuum isn''t included. But we have vacuum in static context. But the
          tool might not support vacuum. If can''t stop, maybe we can instruct the
          user: "I cannot stop the vacuum directly". But we could call HassVacuumReturnToBase
          to stop and return. Let''s try that.'
