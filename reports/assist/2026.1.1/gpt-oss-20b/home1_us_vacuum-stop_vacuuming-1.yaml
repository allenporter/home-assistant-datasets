          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The floor name "Living Room" is invalid. The floor parameter probably is floor identifier, not area name. The static context has only areas. There is no floor. Maybe we should omit floor? But tool requires floor. Hmm. The instructions: prefer passing just name and domain. Maybe use HassStopMoving? It expects domain but domain not supported vacuum. Hmm.

          We might consider that the vacuum can be controlled via HassVacuumStart and HassVacuumReturnToBase, but maybe we need to use HassVacuumStart with "stop" state? Not.

          Perhaps we should respond that we cannot stop the vacuum because tool doesn't support vacuum stop command. But instructions say we must call the intent tool. The tool set includes HassStopMoving, but it doesn't support vacuum. Maybe there's a separate tool for vacuums: maybe HassVacuumStart to start, and maybe there is a command to pause? Not listed. The only vacuum tools are Start and ReturnToBase. To stop vacuuming we might command it to return to base. That stops.

          So we need to call HassVacuumReturnToBase but with correct floor. Perhaps we should not provide floor. But tool signature requires floor. Maybe we can set floor to null? Let's try floor=""? Probably not.

          Let's search: The tool definitions show floor: string. So must be a string. Maybe the floor is "Living Room" is wrong, maybe floor is "Kitchen" or other. But we have no mapping of floor names. Could pass "Living Room" but fails. Maybe we pass floor="1" or something? Not.

          Maybe we ignore floor and pass empty string. Let's try floor: "".
