          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'User: "Lock the lock". They want to lock the lock. We need
          to use HassTurnOn to lock lock. Which lock? There''s "Rear Door Lock" in
          Garage, and "Smart Lock" in Entry. Both are lock domain. Which one to lock?
          The user didn''t specify. The instruction: "When controlling Home Assistant
          always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to
          unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain."
          We have two locks. Need to decide. Probably the main lock is Smart Lock?
          But also Rear Door Lock. Which one is default? There''s no unique. The instruction
          might imply if ambiguous we need to ask. But not given. The question "Lock
          the lock" could be ambiguous. According to guidelines, if controlling a
          specific device but ambiguous, we should ask. But the instruction doesn''t
          explicitly mention asking, but we could choose one? In such scenario, better
          to ask. However, I think the system might prefer the default lock: "Smart
          Lock" in Entry. I''ll lock that. But also there''s "Rear Door Lock". The
          phrase "the lock" might refer to the main entrance lock, which is Smart
          Lock. So we can do HassTurnOn with name "Smart Lock" domain lock. Let''s
          do that.'
