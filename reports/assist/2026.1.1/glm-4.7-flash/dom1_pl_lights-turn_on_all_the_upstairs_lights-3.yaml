          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          \nThe user is asking for \"upstairs lights\". Looking at the areas, I have\
          \ Bedroom 1, 2, 3, and 4. These could be considered upstairs, as well as\
          \ Living Room (which might be upstairs depending on the house layout). \n\
          \nThe prompt says: \"When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific\
          \ type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of\
          \ that type.\"\n\nHowever, this is asking for \"upstairs lights\" - which\
          \ is more like a specific group of devices rather than just turning on all\
          \ lights of a specific type. But it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nActually, let\
          \ me re-read the instruction. It says \"When a user asks to turn on all\
          \ devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there\
          \ is only one device of that type.\"\n\nThe user is asking for \"upstairs\
          \ lights\" - this is asking for lights in a specific area (upstairs), not\
          \ all lights of a specific type (like all lights, all switches, etc.).\n\
          \nBut wait, I need to check if there are multiple areas with lights. Yes,\
          \ there are lights in multiple areas. The instruction says \"unless there\
          \ is only one device of that type.\" But the user is asking for lights in\
          \ upstairs areas, not all lights in the house.\n\nActually, I think I should\
          \ interpret this as: the user wants lights turned on in the upstairs areas.\
          \ The available lights that could be upstairs are in Bedroom 1, 2, 3, 4,\
          \ and possibly Living Room.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The\
          \ instruction says to ask for area specification unless there's only one\
          \ device. But here, I have multiple lights in multiple upstairs areas. \n\
          \nI think the safest approach is to turn on the lights in the areas that\
          \ are typically upstairs (Bedroom 1, 2, 3, 4, and potentially Living Room).\
          \ Let me proceed with turning on these lights.\n\nI should call HassTurnOn\
          \ for each light individually with just the name and domain as recommended."
