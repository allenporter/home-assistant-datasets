          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        content: I'll turn off the lights in the upstairs areas. Let me do that for
          you.
        thinking_content: |-
          The user wants to turn off lights upstairs. I need to determine which areas are "upstairs" and turn off the lights there. Looking at the static context, I can see the following areas with lights:

          - Bedroom 1 Light
          - Bedroom 2 Light
          - Bedroom 3 Light
          - Bedroom 4 Light
          - Dining Room Light
          - Garden Light
          - Kitchen Light
          - Living Room Light
          - Garage Door Opener (also listed as a light)
          - Bedroom 1 Thermostat Humidity
          - Bedroom 1 Thermostat Temperature
          - Bedroom 1 Thermostat

          The bedrooms and dining room might be upstairs, but I don't have explicit information about which floors these rooms are on. However, typically bedrooms are considered upstairs in a house layout. Let me look at this more carefully.

          Actually, looking at the areas:
          - Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2, Bedroom 3, Bedroom 4 - these are likely upstairs
          - Dining Room - could be downstairs
          - Kitchen - likely downstairs
          - Living Room - could be downstairs or upstairs
          - Garage - typically downstairs
          - Backyard - outside

          I should turn off the bedroom lights since those are most likely upstairs. But I should also consider if there are other upstairs lights like Living Room or Dining Room.

          Since the user said "upstairs" generally, I should turn off all the lights that are likely upstairs. The bedrooms seem the most clear candidates. The Living Room and Dining Room could go either way, but typically those are also upstairs in many homes.

          Let me turn off the lights in the areas that are most likely upstairs: Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2, Bedroom 3, Bedroom 4, and maybe Living Room and Dining Room.

          Actually, I should be careful not to make assumptions. The user specifically said "upstairs" so I should turn off the lights in the upstairs areas. Without explicit floor information, I'll turn off the bedroom lights since those are most commonly upstairs. I could also include the living room and dining room as those could be upstairs.

          Let me turn off:
          - Bedroom 1 Light
          - Bedroom 2 Light
          - Bedroom 3 Light
          - Bedroom 4 Light
          - Living Room Light
          - Dining Room Light

          I'll use HassTurnOff for each light. I'll pass the area and domain for each.
