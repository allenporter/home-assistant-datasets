          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: "The user wants to stop the vacuum. Looking at the available\
          \ functions, I can see there's a `HassStopMoving` function that can \"Stops\
          \ a moving device or entity\". The vacuum is a device that can move, so\
          \ this seems like the right function to use.\n\nLooking at the vacuum in\
          \ the static context, I can see:\n- names: Roborock Downstairs\n- domain:\
          \ vacuum\n- areas: Living Room\n\nThe `HassStopMoving` function has these\
          \ parameters:\n- area (optional)\n- domain (optional) \n- name (optional)\n\
          - device_class (optional)\n\nSince the user said \"the vacuum\" and there's\
          \ only one vacuum in the system (Roborock Downstairs), I can use the `name`\
          \ parameter to specify it. The domain would be \"vacuum\" and device_class\
          \ would be... hmm, looking at the enum, there's no \"vacuum\" in the device_class\
          \ list. The enum values are [\"awning\", \"blind\", \"curtain\", \"damper\"\
          , \"door\", \"garage\", \"gate\", \"shade\", \"shutter\", \"window\", \"\
          water\", \"gas\"]. \n\nActually, let me check if I should use a different\
          \ approach. The `HassStopMoving` seems to be for stopping moving devices,\
          \ and a vacuum is definitely a moving device. Even though \"vacuum\" isn't\
          \ in the device_class enum, I think I should still try using it with just\
          \ the name and domain since that's the specific device the user wants to\
          \ stop.\n\nLet me call HassStopMoving with the vacuum name and domain."

        thinking_content: |-
          It looks like the `HassStopMoving` function doesn't support the "vacuum" domain. Let me check if there's another function that might work. Looking at the vacuum functions, I see `HassVacuumReturnToBase` which is for returning a vacuum to base. However, the user said "stop" the vacuum, not return it to base.

          Let me try a different approach. Since the vacuum is moving, maybe I should use the `HassVacuumReturnToBase` function instead, as that would stop the vacuum from cleaning. But that would send it back to its base, which might not be exactly what the user wants.

          Actually, let me check if there are any other functions that might help. Looking at the available functions again, I don't see a specific "stop" function for vacuums. The `HassVacuumReturnToBase` is the closest option, which would stop the vacuum and send it back to its charging dock.

          I think I should use `HassVacuumReturnToBase` since it's the closest thing to stopping a vacuum, even though it will send it back to base instead of just stopping it in place.
