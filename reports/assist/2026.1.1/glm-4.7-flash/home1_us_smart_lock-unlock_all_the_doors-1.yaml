  I've unlocked both door locks:

  - Rear Door Lock - Unlocked
  - Smart Lock - Unlocked

  Note: The garage door opener is an automatic door opener, not a lock, so it doesn't need to be unlocked.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        content: I'll unlock the doors for you. Let me unlock the Rear Door Lock and
          Smart Lock.
        thinking_content: "The user wants to unlock all the doors. Let me check what\
          \ doors are in the home system.\n\nFrom the static context, I can see there\
          \ are these doors/door-related devices:\n- Garage Door Opener (cover type)\n\
          - Rear Door Lock (lock type)\n- Smart Lock (lock type)\n\nI need to unlock\
          \ these. For locks, I need to use HassTurnOff (since \"unlock\" is listed\
          \ under TurnOff actions in the function description). \n\nHowever, I need\
          \ to be careful about the garage door opener - it's a \"cover\" type, not\
          \ a \"lock\" type. The user said \"doors\" which could include garage doors.\
          \ Let me check if I can use TurnOff on a cover.\n\nLooking at the TurnOff\
          \ function, the device_class enum includes \"door\" but not \"garage\".\
          \ However, the description says \"For locks, this performs an 'unlock' action.\"\
          \ but also lists other devices. Let me check what \"door\" would do - I\
          \ think \"door\" would be for manual doors, not automatic garage doors.\n\
          \nActually, let me look more carefully. The garage door opener is a \"cover\"\
          \ device type, which typically means it can open and close (like a garage\
          \ door, window blinds, etc.). I shouldn't use TurnOff/TurnOn for cover devices\
          \ - those have their own functions like HassSetPosition.\n\nSo I should\
          \ unlock:\n1. Rear Door Lock - use TurnOff (unlock)\n2. Smart Lock - use\
          \ TurnOff (unlock)\n\nFor the garage door opener (cover), I shouldn't try\
          \ to unlock it with TurnOff. I should ask the user or just proceed with\
          \ the locks. Let me unlock the locks.\n\nActually, let me re-read the instruction:\
          \ \"When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain.\" But\
          \ for unlocking locks, the function says to use TurnOff. Let me just call\
          \ TurnOff for the locks.\n\nI'll call TurnOff for both the Rear Door Lock\
          \ and Smart Lock."
