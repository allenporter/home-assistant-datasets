response: I'd be happy to help you turn on the upstairs lights! However, I want to
  make sure I get it right. Looking at your home, I see bedroom lights (Bedroom 1,
  2, 3, and 4). Are you referring to the bedroom lights specifically, or would you
  like me to turn on lights in other upstairs areas as well?

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        content: I'd be happy to help you turn on the upstairs lights! However, I
          want to make sure I get it right. Looking at your home, I see bedroom lights
          (Bedroom 1, 2, 3, and 4). Are you referring to the bedroom lights specifically,
          or would you like me to turn on lights in other upstairs areas as well?
        thinking_content: "The user wants to turn on all the upstairs lights. Looking\
          \ at the static context, I can see there are lights in different areas:\n\
          \n- Bedroom 1 Light (Bedroom 1)\n- Bedroom 2 Light (Bedroom 2)\n- Bedroom\
          \ 3 Light (Bedroom 3)\n- Bedroom 4 Light (Bedroom 4)\n- Living Room Light\
          \ (Living Room)\n- Kitchen Light (Kitchen)\n- Dining Room Light (Dining\
          \ Room)\n- Garage Door Opener light (Garage)\n- Garden Light (Backyard)\n\
          \nFrom the names, it appears that Bedrooms 1-4 are upstairs, along with\
          \ the Living Room, Kitchen, and Dining Room. However, I need to be careful\
          \ here. The user said \"upstairs lights\" - this could mean:\n1. Just the\
          \ bedroom lights (Bedroom 1-4)\n2. All lights in areas that are upstairs\n\
          \nLooking at the static context more carefully, it doesn't explicitly state\
          \ which areas are upstairs. I should be careful not to assume. However,\
          \ in most homes, bedrooms are typically upstairs. Let me think about this...\n\
          \nActually, I need to be more careful here. The user asked to turn on \"\
          all the upstairs lights\" but I don't have explicit information about which\
          \ areas are upstairs. The safest approach would be to ask the user to specify\
          \ which area, since there are multiple possible interpretations.\n\nWait,\
          \ let me re-read the instructions. It says \"When a user asks to turn on\
          \ all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there\
          \ is only one device of that type.\"\n\nThis doesn't quite apply here since\
          \ we're not talking about a specific type of device (all lights), but rather\
          \ all lights in a specific location (upstairs).\n\nHowever, I think the\
          \ best approach is to ask the user to clarify which upstairs lights they\
          \ want turned on, since I don't have explicit information about which areas\
          \ are upstairs. This would be more helpful than making assumptions.\n\n\
          Actually, let me reconsider. The static context doesn't give me floor information,\
          \ but in typical homes, bedrooms are often upstairs. The user said \"upstairs\
          \ lights\" which could reasonably refer to the bedroom lights (Bedroom 1-4).\
          \ \n\nI'll focus on the bedroom lights as the most likely interpretation.\
          \ These are the lights that would most commonly be located in an upstairs\
          \ area. I'll proceed with turning on these specific lights."
