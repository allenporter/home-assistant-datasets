          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        content: I'll set the volume to 50% on the Outdoor Speakers.
        thinking_content: "The user wants to turn the volume down to 50%. I need to\
          \ use the `HassSetVolume` function to set the volume to 50%.\n\nLooking\
          \ at the function parameters:\n- volume_level: required parameter, should\
          \ be 50\n- area: optional\n- device_class: optional  \n- domain: optional\n\
          - floor: optional\n- name: optional\n\nThe user didn't specify which media\
          \ player or area they want to set the volume on. Looking at the static context,\
          \ I can see there's an \"Outdoor Speakers\" in the \"Rooftop Terrace\" area\
          \ that's a media_player domain.\n\nHowever, the user didn't specify which\
          \ device, so I should ask them to clarify which device or area they want\
          \ to control, since the function has optional parameters and I shouldn't\
          \ assume which device to target.\n\nWait, let me re-read the instructions.\
          \ It says \"When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain.\"\
          \ But the user didn't specify which device. The instructions also say \"\
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to\
          \ specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.\"\n\nIn\
          \ this case, there's only one media_player in the system (Outdoor Speakers),\
          \ so technically I could assume that's what they want. But it's safer to\
          \ ask for clarification since volume control on speakers could be ambiguous.\n\
          \nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The user said \"Turn\
          \ the volume down to 50%\" - this is a general statement without specifying\
          \ a device. Since there are multiple areas with potential media players,\
          \ and I should ask for clarification when the user asks about devices of\
          \ a specific type without specifying an area, I should ask which device\
          \ or area they want to control.\n\nBut wait, there's only one media_player\
          \ device in the entire system - Outdoor Speakers in Rooftop Terrace. So\
          \ in this specific case, it's clear which device they're referring to. I\
          \ could proceed with that one.\n\n\nI'll proceed with the specific details,\
          \ using the Outdoor Speakers in Rooftop Terrace as the target device. I'll\
          \ set the volume to exactly 50% using the HassSetVolume function with precise\
          \ domain and area parameters."
