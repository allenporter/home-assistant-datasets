response: |-
  I've successfully set the volume to 0% on both media players in your home:

  1. Nest Hub (Living Room) - Volume set to 0%
  2. Smart Speaker (Game Room) - Volume set to 0%

  Both devices are now at 0% volume level.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          I see that you want to set the volume to 0%. Based on the live context, I can see there are media players in the living room (Nest Hub) and game room (Smart Speaker) that have volume levels.

          Let me mute both media players to achieve 0% volume:

          I apologize for the error. Let me try a different approach to set the volume to 0% on the media players in your home. Instead of muting them, I'll directly set their volume levels to 0%.

          Let's set the volume for the Nest Hub in the Living Room to 0%:
