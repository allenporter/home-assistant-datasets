Answer is in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point. To set an irrigation valve position, you can use Home Assistant's `HassSetPosition` function with appropriate arguments such as area name (if applicable), device class or domain ('irrigation'), floor number if there are multiple floors within a zone of that type in your smart home network and the specific location where it is located.
