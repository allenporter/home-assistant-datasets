          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
          - names: Smart Curtain
            domain: cover
            areas: Living Room

        content: I'll set the living room curtains to 50% for you.
        thinking_content: |-
          The user wants to set the living room curtains to 50%. Looking at the static context, I can see there's a "Smart Curtain" device in the "Living Room" area with domain "cover".

          I need to use the HassSetPosition function to set the curtain to 50%. Let me check the parameters:
          - name: "Smart Curtain" (from the static context)
          - position: 50 (the user specified 50%)
          - area: "Living Room" (optional but good to specify)
          - domain: ["cover"] (optional but good to specify)
          - device_class: none needed

          The user specifically mentioned "living room curtains" which matches the Smart Curtain device.
