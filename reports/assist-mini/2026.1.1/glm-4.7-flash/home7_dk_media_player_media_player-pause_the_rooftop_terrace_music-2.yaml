          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
          - names: Outdoor Speakers
            domain: media_player
            areas: Rooftop Terrace
        created: 2026-01-25 18:47:43.465024+00:00

        content: I'll pause the music on the Rooftop Terrace for you.
        thinking_content: |-
          The user wants to pause music on the Rooftop Terrace. Looking at the available functions, I can see there's a `HassMediaPause` function that can pause a media player.

          Let me check the parameters:
          - area: "Rooftop Terrace" (this matches what the user provided)
          - device_class: optional, array of ["tv", "speaker", "receiver"]
          - domain: optional, array of ["media_player"]
          - floor: optional
          - name: optional

          The user specifically mentioned "Rooftop Terrace music" and from the static context, I can see there's an "Outdoor Speakers" media_player in the "Rooftop Terrace" area. So I should use the area parameter to target that specific location.

          I'll call the HassMediaPause function with the area parameter set to "Rooftop Terrace".
