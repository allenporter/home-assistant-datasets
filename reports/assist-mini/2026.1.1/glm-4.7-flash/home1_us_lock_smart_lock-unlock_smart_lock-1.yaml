          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user wants to unlock the smart lock. According to my instructions, I should use `HassTurnOff` for unlock actions (since "For locks, this performs an 'unlock' action. Use for requests like 'turn off', 'deactivate', 'disable', or 'unlock'").

          The lock is in the "Entry" area. I should call HassTurnOff with the lock domain and specify the name or area. The user didn't specify which smart lock, but based on the static context, there's one smart lock in the Entry area. I'll use the area to identify it.

          Actually, let me reconsider. The instruction says "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." The lock is named "Smart Lock" in the "Entry" area. I should call HassTurnOff with:
          - domain: ["lock"]
          - name: "Smart Lock"

          Or I could use the area parameter. Let me use just the name since that's the preferred method according to the instructions.
