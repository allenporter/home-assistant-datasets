          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user wants to close the garage door. Looking at the available devices, I can see there's a "Garage Door Opener" with domain "cover" in the "Garage" area. This is likely the garage door since covers can be garage doors.

          To close the garage door, I should use the `HassSetPosition` function with position set to close (typically 0 or a closed position). However, looking at the function parameters, the `position` parameter is required, but I'm not sure what position value represents "closed" for a garage door.

          Let me think about this - for blinds/curtains, position 0 might be closed, but for garage doors, it might be different. I should try to set it to what would be considered closed. Since the user just said "close the garage door" and I don't have specific information about the position values for garage doors, I'll try setting it to a closed position.

          Actually, looking more carefully at the device class options: "garage" is listed as one of the possible device classes. The device is named "Garage Door Opener" with domain "cover" in area "Garage". So I should use:
          - name: "Garage Door Opener"
          - domain: ["cover"]
          - device_class: ["garage"]

          For the position, since the user wants it closed, I'll try to set it to what would be a closed position. For covers, 0 is typically closed, but I'm not 100% sure for garage doors. I'll try 0 first.
