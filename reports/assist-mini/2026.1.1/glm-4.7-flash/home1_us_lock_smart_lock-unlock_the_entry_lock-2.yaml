          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user wants to unlock the entry lock. Looking at the static context, I can see there's a "Smart Lock" device with domain "lock" in the "Entry" area.

          For unlocking a lock, I should use the `HassTurnOff` function according to the instructions: "Use for requests like 'turn off', 'deactivate', 'disable', or 'unlock'."

          I need to call HassTurnOff with:
          - name: "Smart Lock" (from the static context)
          - area: "Entry" (from the static context)

          I got a "MatchFailedError" because there are multiple devices with the name "Smart Lock" in the Entry area - one is a binary_sensor and one is a lock. I need to be more specific.

          Let me call GetLiveContext first to see the current state and get more specific entity information.
