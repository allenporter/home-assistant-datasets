          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
          - names: Smart Curtain
            domain: cover
            areas: Living Room
          - names: Smart Curtain Battery
            domain: sensor
            areas: Living Room
        created: 2026-01-25 18:46:44.485558+00:00
      - role: user
        content: Close the living room smart curtain
        attachments: null
        created: 2026-01-25 18:46:44.485093+00:00
      - role: assistant
        agent_id: conversation.mock_title
        content: I'll close the smart curtain in the living room for you.
        thinking_content: |-
          The user wants to close the living room smart curtain. Let me look at the static context to understand what devices are available.

          From the static context:
          - names: Smart Curtain
            domain: cover
            areas: Living Room
          - names: Smart Curtain Battery
            domain: sensor
            areas: Living Room

          So there's a "Smart Curtain" device that is a "cover" type in the "Living Room" area. To close a curtain, I need to set its position to 0 (closed). I should use the HassSetPosition function with position=0.

          Let me call the function with the appropriate parameters:
          - name: "Smart Curtain"
          - area: "Living Room"
          - domain: ["cover"]
          - position: 0
