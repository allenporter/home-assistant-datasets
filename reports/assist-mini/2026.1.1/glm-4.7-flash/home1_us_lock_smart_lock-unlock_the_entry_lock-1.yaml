          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user wants to unlock the entry lock. I need to use the HassTurnOff function for this action since unlocking is considered the opposite of locking. Looking at the static context, there's a lock called "Smart Lock" in the "Entry" area.

          I should use HassTurnOff with:
          - name: "Smart Lock"
          - area: "Entry"

          Wait, let me re-read the instructions. It says:
          - Use HassTurnOff to unlock a lock
          - When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain

          So I should pass the name and domain, not the area. Let me check the function parameters again:

          HassTurnOff parameters:
          - area (optional)
          - domain (optional)
          - name (optional)

          The instructions say "prefer passing just name and domain" for devices. So I should pass:
          - name: "Smart Lock"
          - domain: ["lock"]

          Actually, looking more carefully at the instructions, it says "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." The domain for a lock is "lock" and the name is "Smart Lock". The area is also specified in the context, but I should prioritize name and domain as instructed.

          Let me call HassTurnOff with just the name and domain.
