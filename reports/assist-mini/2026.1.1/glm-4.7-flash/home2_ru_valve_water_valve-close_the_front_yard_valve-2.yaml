          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:

          The user wants to close the front yard valve. Based on the static context, I can see there's an "Irrigation Valve" in the "Front yard" area with domain "valve".

          To close a valve, I need to use the `HassTurnOff` function since closing a valve would be turning off a water device. The device class should be "water" for a valve.

          Let me call the function with:
          - name: "Irrigation Valve" (from the context)
          - area: "Front yard" (from the context)
          - domain: ["valve"] (the domain of the valve)
          - device_class: ["water"] (valves are water devices)

          The error suggests that the device class "water" doesn't match. Let me try again without specifying the device_class, since the error indicates it's a valve domain device and the system couldn't match it with the water device class.

          Looking at the static context again:
          - names: Irrigation Valve
          - domain: valve
          - areas: Front yard

          I should try without the device_class parameter.
