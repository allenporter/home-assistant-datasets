          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'We need to close the living room smart curtain. This is
          a cover. The user says "Close the living room smart curtain". We need to
          use HassTurnOff? Wait for cover, closing is probably turn_off? The instruction:
          "When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn
          to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock." For other devices, they say "When
          controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." For covers,
          closing is probably "turn_off" or "turn_on"? In HA covers, closing is usually
          "turn_off" or "close" action. Usually it''s "turn_off" in the code: for
          covers, turning off closes. So we should call HassTurnOff with domain cover,
          name "Smart Curtain", area "Living Room". Let''s do that.'
