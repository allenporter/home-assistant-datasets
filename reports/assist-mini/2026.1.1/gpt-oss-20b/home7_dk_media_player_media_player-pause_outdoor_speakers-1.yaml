          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
          - names: Outdoor Speakers
            domain: media_player
            areas: Rooftop Terrace
        created: 2026-01-18 13:31:20.568761+00:00

          The user says: "Pause Outdoor Speakers". This is a command to pause the media player Outdoor Speakers. We need to use HassMediaPause with domain media_player, name "Outdoor Speakers". Also area: "Rooftop Terrace"? According to static context: names: Outdoor Speakers, domain: media_player, areas: Rooftop Terrace. The rule says: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." So we can pass name and domain only. Possibly also area but not necessary. So call HassMediaPause with {name: "Outdoor Speakers", domain: ["media_player"]? domain can be a string or array? In tool definitions: domain: any[]. So we can pass array. But in instruction: "prefer passing just name and domain." So we need to pass domain "media_player". So call HassMediaPause with name: "Outdoor Speakers", domain: ["media_player"]? Or domain: "media_player"? The type says domain: any[]. Might accept array. But we can also pass just string maybe. But better to follow type: array. So domain: ["media_player"].

          Area: optional. Not necessary. But we can provide area "Rooftop Terrace". But instruction: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." So maybe don't provide area. So we just pass name and domain.

          Thus call HassMediaPause with {name: "Outdoor Speakers", domain: ["media_player"]}. Also include other fields? The type signature includes area: string, device_class: any[], domain: any[], floor: string, name: string. But instructions: prefer just name and domain. But tool signature requires these keys: area, device_class, domain, floor, name. But we can still set defaults? We can omit or set empty. Probably we need to provide all required fields. But the instruction says "prefer passing just name and domain". So we should pass name and domain only? The tool expects area: string etc. Possibly it's optional. But I think we can pass minimal. I'll include only name and domain.

          Thus:

          ```json
          {
          "name": "Outdoor Speakers",
          "domain": ["media_player"]
          }
          ```

          But we might need area: "Rooftop Terrace". The type signature includes area string, domain any[], floor string, name string. But it's not mandated in instruction. I'd supply area to be safe. But the instruction says prefer passing just name and domain, but we can include area if needed. I think we can pass area and domain. That might be safer. Let's include area "Rooftop Terrace".

          So:

          {
          "area":"Rooftop Terrace",
          "domain": ["media_player"],
          "name": "Outdoor Speakers"
          }

          We might not need device_class or floor. They can be omitted or empty. I think we can leave them out.

          Thus call HassMediaPause.
