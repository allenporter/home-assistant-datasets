          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
          - names: Roborock Downstairs
            domain: vacuum
            areas: Living Room

          The user wants to start Roborock Downstairs vacuum. We have the static context: names: Roborock Downstairs, domain: vacuum, areas: Living Room. So we need to call HassVacuumStart with appropriate arguments: area maybe "Living Room", domain ["vacuum"], floor maybe unspecified? The tool signature: HassVacuumStart takes object with area: string, domain: any[], floor: string, name: string.

          We have name: "Roborock Downstairs". Domain: ["vacuum"]. Area: "Living Room". Floor: maybe unspecified; maybe we can leave empty string. But the tool might require a string; we can provide "Ground Floor" or something. But we can guess floor: "Ground Floor" or "First Floor". But we have only one vacuum. The floor may be "Ground Floor". But we have no info. We can use "Floor 1". But safer to provide something like "Floor 1". The tool probably expects a string, but may not use it.

          Thus we will call HassVacuumStart with area: "Living Room", domain: ["vacuum"], floor: "Ground Floor", name: "Roborock Downstairs".
