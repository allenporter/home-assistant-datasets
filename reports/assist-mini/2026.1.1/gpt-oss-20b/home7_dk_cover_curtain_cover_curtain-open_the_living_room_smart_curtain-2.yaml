          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
          - names: Smart Curtain
            domain: cover
            areas: Living Room
          - names: Smart Curtain Battery

          We need to interpret user request: "Open the living room smart curtain". It's a cover, we need to set position maybe. The instruction says: For controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. For opening, we might need to use HassSetPosition or maybe HassTurnOn? For a cover, open is not 'turn on' but 'set position'. The function available: HassSetPosition requires name, domain, area, device_class, floor, position. We can use 100% open? Usually open position is 100. So we should call HassSetPosition with name="Smart Curtain", domain="cover", area="Living Room", position=100. We might not need device_class or floor, but need to supply them? The instructions: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." So we should pass just name and domain? But function signature requires all parameters. We could provide empty arrays for device_class and domain? Domain is required as array? Let's examine function signature: HassSetPosition({_: { area: string, device_class: any[], domain: any[], floor: string, name: string, position: number, })}. So we need to provide area, domain, floor, etc. For domain, we can provide ["cover"]? The instructions said prefer passing just name and domain, but function requires more. Maybe we can still pass domain array containing cover. Let's pass domain: ["cover"], name: "Smart Curtain", area: "Living Room", floor: ""? Provide empty string. device_class: [] maybe. position: 100.

          Thus, we call HassSetPosition.
