          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
          - names: Roborock Downstairs
            domain: vacuum
            areas: Living Room

          The user says: "Start vacuum in the living room". According to instructions, to start vacuum, use HassVacuumStart. The tool signature: HassVacuumStart requires area, domain, floor, name. We know area is "Living Room", domain is "vacuum", floor maybe not specified? The static context lists "Roborock Downstairs" as vacuum. The name likely "Roborock Downstairs". The floor not provided. Maybe we can guess floor: "downstairs" or just not required? The function signature has floor: string. We need to provide all four: area, domain, floor, name.

          We have area: "Living Room". Domain: ["vacuum"] or just "vacuum". Name: "Roborock Downstairs". Floor: maybe "Downstairs" or empty string? The instructions say "Prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain." For vacuum start, we need area and domain anyway. So we pass area: "Living Room", domain: ["vacuum"], floor: "" (or maybe "downstairs"?). But it's a required string. We can pass "Downstairs". There's no other context. We'll just set floor: "Downstairs".

          We'll call HassVacuumStart with that.

          We should respond acknowledging starting vacuum.

          The error: MatchFailedError, invalid floor. There's no floor "Downstairs" in the house. We should set floor to something that matches. The static context does not specify floors. Usually Home Assistant floors: maybe "floor" not used? But the tool requires floor. We need to provide floor that exists. Since we don't know, we might try blank string? But empty string may not be valid. Maybe we can skip floor? But the signature requires floor: string.

          The error says no match for floor 'Downstairs'. We need to provide floor name that matches an existing floor. There's no floor data given. Possibly we can use "floor": ""? But that might also fail. Let's try "floor":"". But that might not match either. Alternatively, maybe we can set floor: "floor1" or something? There's no such info. The tool says "floor_name". Might need to use a known floor. If there are no floors, maybe we set floor: "floor 1" but no guarantee. Perhaps we can not specify floor? But we need to pass a string. The best guess is to use the domain and name only. But tool signature requires floor. We can maybe use "floor":"downstairs". But error indicates "Downstairs" is invalid. We could try "floor":"". Let's try floor:"" (empty). That might still not match. But maybe it will default to empty.

          Let's attempt floor:"" and domain: "vacuum".
