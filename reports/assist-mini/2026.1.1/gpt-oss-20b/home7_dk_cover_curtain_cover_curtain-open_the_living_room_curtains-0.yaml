          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          User wants to open living room curtains. The curtain is a cover. To open, need to call HassTurnOn or HassSetPosition? For curtains, to open, the action is "turn on" or "set position"? Probably use HassTurnOn to open. The tool: HassTurnOn expects area, device_class, domain, floor, name. The user wants to open living room curtains. Domain is cover, name is "Smart Curtain". Use area "Living Room". device_class? The instructions: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." So we should call HassTurnOn with name and domain? But tool signature includes other fields: area, device_class, domain, floor, name. The instructions: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." That likely means we set name and domain only and leave other fields unspecified? But tool requires all fields. Maybe we can provide area and domain? Let's interpret: pass just name and domain and leave area blank? But need area? The tool signature demands all fields. However, the instructions say prefer passing just name and domain. This might mean we should include name, domain and maybe area if needed. But I'd include name and domain only and skip area. But tool signature doesn't accept omission. Let's just include name and domain only, and set other fields empty. But tool may fail if missing. Possibly we can provide area as "Living Room" and domain "cover", name "Smart Curtain". device_class and floor can be empty strings. That seems acceptable.

          So call HassTurnOn with area: "Living Room", domain: ["cover"]? It expects domain: any[]. The domain array includes cover. Similarly device_class array can be empty. name: "Smart Curtain". floor maybe "".

          Let's do that.
