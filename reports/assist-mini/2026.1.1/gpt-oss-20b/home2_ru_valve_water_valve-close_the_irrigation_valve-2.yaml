          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
          - names: Irrigation Valve
            domain: valve
            areas: Front yard

        thinking_content: "The user says \"close the irrigation valve\". In context,\
          \ we have a device: \"Irrigation Valve\" domain valve. The instructions\
          \ say: To control Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn\
          \ to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. For valves, I think turning\
          \ on means opening the valve, turning off means closing it. But the instructions\
          \ say use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. That's for\
          \ locks only. For valves we likely should use HassTurnOff or HassTurnOn\
          \ depending. The user wants to close the irrigation valve. That means turning\
          \ it off. So we need to call HassTurnOff. The tool signature: HassTurnOff\
          \ takes area, device_class, domain, floor, name. They say prefer passing\
          \ just name and domain when controlling a device. So we can pass name: \"\
          Irrigation Valve\", domain: \"valve\". But the function signature expects\
          \ all fields: area, device_class, domain, floor, name. However instruction:\
          \ \"When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain.\" That\
          \ implies we can provide just name and domain and the rest optional? The\
          \ function signature requires all fields. But maybe the tool allows partial?\
          \ But instructions say prefer passing just name and domain. So we should\
          \ call HassTurnOff with name=\"Irrigation Valve\", domain=\"valve\". For\
          \ area, maybe we can leave it empty string? But might be required. But we\
          \ can also pass area=\"Front yard\" as that's where the valve is. But instruction\
          \ says prefer passing just name and domain. But we must meet function signature.\
          \ We can set area=\"\"? But might cause error. I think we should provide\
          \ area \"Front yard\". But instruction is ambiguous. The tool requires fields;\
          \ we can pass all. But instruction: \"When controlling a device, prefer\
          \ passing just name and domain.\" Means we can omit area. But tool signature\
          \ expects. However maybe tool can handle missing values? In practice, maybe\
          \ we provide name and domain only. But we need to call HassTurnOff with\
          \ object. Let's construct:\n\n{\n  area: \"\",\n  device_class: [],\n  domain:\
          \ [\"valve\"],\n  floor: \"\",\n  name: \"Irrigation Valve\"\n}\n\nBut device_class\
          \ array maybe empty. domain array maybe [\"valve\"]. The tool signature:\
          \ domain: any[]. So we pass [\"valve\"]. area string maybe \"\". floor string\
          \ maybe \"\". device_class array maybe [].\n\nLet's output a tool call:\
          \ \n\n{\n  \"name\": \"HassTurnOff\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"area\"\
          : \"\",\n    \"device_class\": [],\n    \"domain\": [\"valve\"],\n    \"\
          floor\": \"\",\n    \"name\": \"Irrigation Valve\"\n  }\n}\n\nBut typical\
          \ usage: HassTurnOff for locks, but valves also have on/off. I'll use HassTurnOff."
