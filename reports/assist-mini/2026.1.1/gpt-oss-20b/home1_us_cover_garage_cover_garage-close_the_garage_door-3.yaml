          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
          - names: Garage Door Opener
            domain: cover

          The user wants to close the garage door. The garage door is a cover entity. We should use HassTurnOff to "turn off" or "close" a cover? The instructions say: For locks use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock. But for covers? It says: "Turns off/closes a device or entity." So use HassTurnOff. So we need to call HassTurnOff with name: "Garage Door Opener", domain: cover. Area: Garage.

          We should pass just name and domain. The instructions say prefer passing just name and domain for device. For area, prefer passing just area name and domain. But we have domain cover. For device, domain is cover, name is Garage Door Opener. We can include area: Garage.

          Thus the function call: HassTurnOff({name: "Garage Door Opener", domain: ["cover"], area: "Garage"}). The tool signature: HassTurnOff takes area, device_class, domain, floor, name. We can pass area: "Garage", domain: ["cover"], name: "Garage Door Opener". device_class maybe omitted or empty. floor maybe omitted.

          We call HassTurnOff.
