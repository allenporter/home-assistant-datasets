          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
          - names: Smart Curtain
            domain: cover
            areas: Living Room
          - names: Smart Curtain Battery
            domain: sensor
            areas: Living Room

          We have a user request: "Open the living room curtains". We need to control Home Assistant: Open the curtains. The tool for that is HassTurnOn or HassTurnOff? According to the instructions: For locks, HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock. For devices, use HassTurnOn to turn on. But "open the curtains" is a cover. So we should use HassTurnOn? However the tool definitions:

          - HassTurnOn: "Turns on/closes a device or entity. For locks, this performs a 'lock' action. Use for requests like 'turn on', 'activate', 'enable', or 'lock'."
          - HassTurnOff: "Turns off/closes a device or entity. For locks, this performs an 'unlock' action. Use for requests like 'turn off', 'deactivate', 'disable', or 'unlock'."

          But for covers, the state is open/close. Which function is appropriate? For opening, it's like turning on? But the instruction says "turn on" for devices. For covers, opening is like turning on the cover? There's no explicit tool for open/close. But we can interpret: open = turn on? Or we might need to use HassTurnOn. There's no HassOpenCover function. So we will call HassTurnOn for the name: "Smart Curtain" and domain: cover.

          We need to pass name and domain. Possibly area is Living Room. The tool signature: HassTurnOn accepts area, device_class, domain, floor, name. We need to provide area: "Living Room", name: "Smart Curtain", domain: "cover". We can provide empty arrays for device_class and floor? The instructions: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." But the function requires all fields. We can fill empty strings or nulls. But typical usage: set area: "Living Room", name: "Smart Curtain", domain: "cover", others empty or null.

          Thus: call HassTurnOn with area:"Living Room", name:"Smart Curtain", domain:"cover", device_class: [], floor: "". Let's do that.

          Then respond to user: "The curtains are opening."
