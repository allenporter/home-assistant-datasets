          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          User says "close the irrigation valve". According to instructions, when controlling a lock, use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock. But irrigation valve is a valve, not a lock. We need to understand how to "close" a valve. There's no explicit tool for closing a valve. We might need to use HassTurnOff? But instructions: use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. That's for locks only. For other devices, likely use HassTurnOn and HassTurnOff as general functions? The tool definitions: HassTurnOn turns on / opens / presses a device or entity. For locks, this performs a 'lock' action. HassTurnOff turns off / closes / unlocks. So we can use HassTurnOff to close the valve.

          Thus we need to call HassTurnOff with area: Front yard, domain: valve, name: Irrigation Valve. The instructions say: When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. So we can do HassTurnOff({name: "Irrigation Valve", domain: "valve"}). Should we include area? The instruction says when controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. So do that.

          Thus we call the function.
