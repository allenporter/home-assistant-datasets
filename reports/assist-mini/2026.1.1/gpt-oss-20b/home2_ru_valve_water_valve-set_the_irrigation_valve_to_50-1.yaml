          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          We have user wants to set irrigation valve to 50%. The device is of type valve. The tool: HassSetPosition. We need name: Irrigation Valve. Domain: valve. Use HassSetPosition. Position 50. According to instructions: When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. So call HassSetPosition with name "Irrigation Valve", domain "valve", area "Front yard" perhaps. The tool signature expects area, device_class, domain, floor, name, position. We can pass domain array? The type expects domain: any[]? They want pass just name and domain. But the function signature requires multiple fields. Let's see signature: type HassSetPosition = (_: { area: string, device_class: any[], domain: any[], floor: string, name: string, position: number, }) => any;

          We might supply domain as array or string? Probably as array. But instructions: prefer passing just name and domain. But must fill all fields; we can set other fields as empty or undefined? Might cause error. Perhaps we can pass minimal fields: name, domain, position. But signature includes others. We need to supply something.

          Given guidelines, we might call with domain "valve", name "Irrigation Valve", position 50. Also maybe area: "Front yard". domain field expects array? Let's put domain: ["valve"]. device_class? Possibly leave empty array. floor? Maybe empty string. device_class: [], floor: "".

          Thus call HassSetPosition with area: "Front yard", device_class: [], domain: ["valve"], floor: "", name: "Irrigation Valve", position: 50.

          After calling, respond to user that valve set to 50%.
