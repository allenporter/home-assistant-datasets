          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

        thinking_content: 'The user: "Open the living room curtains". The static context:
          device "Smart Curtain" domain cover, area Living Room. They want to open
          the curtains. In Home Assistant, cover is a device class; open or close
          is a cover action. We use HassTurnOn? Actually, for covers, the correct
          service might be ''open_cover'' but the tool specification says use HassTurnOn
          to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. That is specifically for locks.
          For covers, we don''t have a tool for open/close. But the instructions say
          "When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools." We have
          only HassTurnOn and HassTurnOff. But those are for locks only. There''s
          no tool for covers. So maybe we can interpret that opening the curtain is
          like "turn on" but that seems wrong. The tool instructions mention using
          HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. Not for covers. But
          maybe we can still call HassTurnOn with domain cover? The instructions say
          "Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock." So for covers,
          it''s not a lock. There''s no tool. So maybe we can''t use tool. But we
          must use intent tools when controlling home assistant. So we might use HassTurnOn
          to open the curtain. But that would be semantically incorrect. But the instructions:
          "When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn
          to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer
          passing just name and domain." They didn''t specify cover action. But maybe
          we can call HassTurnOn? Let''s see: For lock: "turn on" = lock, "turn off"
          = unlock. For covers, maybe we can use "turn on" to open? But I think the
          proper tool isn''t provided. But the system says we must use intent tools.
          So we will call HassTurnOn with name "Smart Curtain" and domain cover. That
          will probably cause cover to open. Let''s do that.'
