          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:

          We need to close the garage door. That is a cover. Use HassTurnOff. Provide name "Garage Door Opener", domain cover. The instructions say to prefer just name and domain. So call HassTurnOff with name: "Garage Door Opener", domain: ["cover"] (list?). In the tool signature, domain: any[].

          We do not need to provide area? They said for controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. So we can omit area and others. The tool signature requires area: string. But we can probably pass empty string? The instructions say prefer passing just name and domain. But the tool signature requires area. But maybe we can pass empty string for area. The tool signature fields: area: string, device_class: any[], domain: any[], floor: string, name: string. We need to fill all. Use area empty string? Not sure.

          But in previous similar tasks, they've passed area: "".

          I'll call HassTurnOff with name: "Garage Door Opener", domain: ["cover"], area: "", device_class: [], floor: "".
