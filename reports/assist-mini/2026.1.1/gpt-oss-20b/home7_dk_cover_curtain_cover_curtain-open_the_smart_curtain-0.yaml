          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          We have a command: "Open the smart curtain". According to instructions, controlling Home Assistant uses HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock. But that's for locks. For curtain? It's a cover device. We should use HassTurnOn or HassTurnOff? The tool functions are HassTurnOn and HassTurnOff, but they refer to locks. The instruction says: "Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock." Actually it's reversed: "Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock." That's weird. But the device is a cover. Typically we want to open the curtain, that would be a cover. The tool names don't specify cover, but the domain is 'cover'. The instructions say "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." So we should call HassTurnOn? But the instructions specifically say "Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock." That seems contradictory: HassTurnOn is to lock? Usually lock is an entity that you lock with lock, but here it's reversed? Let's read: "Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock." That is odd but okay. For cover we need to open; that is not a lock. But we don't have a dedicated open tool. But we can use HassSetPosition to set position. The cover likely has a position. But we only have HassSetPosition available. But we can use HassTurnOn? I think we need to use HassSetPosition to open the curtain fully: position 100. The instructions: "Use HassSetPosition to set the position of a device or entity". So we should use HassSetPosition. We must provide area, device_class, domain, floor, name, position. The static context: Smart Curtain, domain: cover, areas: Living Room. So area is "Living Room". device_class? unknown. domain: cover. name: "Smart Curtain". position: 100 (fully open). Floor? None provided. We can leave floor unspecified? The function requires floor: string. Probably we set floor as empty string or null? The tool signature: floor: string. So we can put floor: "".

          Let's call HassSetPosition with name "Smart Curtain", domain "cover", area "Living Room", floor "", position 100.
