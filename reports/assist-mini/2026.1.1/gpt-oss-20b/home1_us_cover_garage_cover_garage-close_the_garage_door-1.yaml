          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Static Context: An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
          - names: Garage Door Opener
            domain: cover
            areas: Garage

          We need to interpret the user's request: "Close the garage door". That likely means to close the cover. So we need to use HassTurnOff with domain cover. Actually for covers, the action to close is TurnOff or TurnOn? For a garage door opener, I think turning off closes it? Typically, 'turn off' closes the cover, 'turn on' opens. But we have to use HassTurnOff for lock/unlock? No, we use HassTurnOff for turn off, open/press. The instructions: Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. For devices, use HassTurnOn/HassTurnOff? The function HassTurnOn/Off accept area, name, domain. For a cover, you can turn off? The domain is cover. So we call HassTurnOff with area "Garage", name "Garage Door Opener", domain cover.

          Thus answer: we will call HassTurnOff. No text needed? The system expects calling the tool. In this environment, we must call the function.
