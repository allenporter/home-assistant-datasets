          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          The user wants to set the irrigation valve to 50%. The device is a valve. According to instructions: "Use HassSetPosition to set the position". For locks, use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock. For other devices, we should use HassSetPosition for the valve.

          We need to pass name, domain, and position. The tool signature: HassSetPosition takes {area, device_class, domain, floor, name, position}. But instructions: "When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain." So likely we can pass name, domain, position. Probably we need to provide area? The tool signature requires area, device_class, domain, floor, name, position. But they say prefer passing just name and domain. But must match function signature. Let's assume we pass name and domain; maybe others optional? But we must pass all keys. Let's fill: name: "Irrigation Valve", domain: "valve", area: "Front yard". device_class, floor unspecified. Use empty array? Probably we can omit optional fields? We'll supply empty array for device_class, floor as "". But better to pass minimal required: name, domain, position. The tool signature indicates all keys are required. We need to decide what to put for the others.

          We have areas: Front yard. So area: "Front yard". Domain: "valve". Name: "Irrigation Valve". Position: 50.

          device_class: empty array. floor: empty string.

          Thus we call HassSetPosition with those parameters.
