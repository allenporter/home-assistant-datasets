    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Here's the YAML code for the blueprint you can add to Home Assistant:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Light on Door
    description: Turn on a light when a door opens, turn off when door closes or after timeout.
    domain: automation
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: Door Sensor
        description: The binary_sensor that triggers when the door opens
        selector:
          entity:
            filter:
              domain: binary_sensor
      light_switch:
        name: Light Switch
        description: The light(s) to control
        selector:
          target:
            domain: light

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"

  condition: []
  action:
    - choose:
        - conditions:
            - condition: template
              value_template: "{{ trigger.to_state.state == 'on' }}"
          sequence:
            - service: light.turn_on
              target: !input light_switch
            - wait_for_trigger:
                - platform: state
                  entity_id: !input door_sensor
                  to: "off"
              timeout:
                minutes: 2
            - service: light.turn_off
              target: !input light_switch
      default: []
  ```

  ## How to use it

  1. Go to **Configuration** → **Blueprints** in Home Assistant
  2. Click the menu (three dots) in the top right → **Import blueprint**
  3. Paste the YAML above
  4. Create an automation from this blueprint and select:
     - **Door Sensor**: `binary_sensor.pantry_door`
     - **Light Switch**: `light.pantry_light`

  This will turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens, and turn it off either when the door closes or after 2 minutes.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
