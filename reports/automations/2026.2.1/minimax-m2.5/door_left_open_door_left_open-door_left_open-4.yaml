    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here's a Home Assistant blueprint for a door left open alert:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Door Left Open Alert

          hours: 0
          minutes: 5
          seconds: 0

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
      for: !input open_duration

  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      state: "on"

  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target: !input alert_media
      data:
        media_content_type: music
  ```

  **To use this blueprint:**

  1. Save it as `door_left_open_alert.yaml` in your `blueprints/automation/` folder
  2. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints**
  3. Click **Create Automation** and select "Door Left Open Alert"
  4. Configure the inputs:
     - **Door Sensor**: Select your door sensor (e.g., Entry Door)
     - **Alert Media**: Select a media player and the media to play
     - **Open Duration**: Set how long the door should be open before alerting

  **Example configurations:**

  - Garage door left open for 30 minutes → Select garage door sensor + living room speaker + 30 min duration
  - Front door ajar for 5 minutes → Select front door sensor + kitchen speaker + 5 min duration

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          # Door left open

          ## Problem statement

          Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
          left open.

          ## Example use cases

          These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

          - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
          - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

          ## Detailed Description

          The blueprint should accept two inputs:

          | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
          | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
          | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
          | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
          | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

          The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

          **To use this blueprint:**

          1. Save it as `door_left_open_alert.yaml` in your `blueprints/automation/` folder
          2. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints**
          3. Click **Create Automation** and select "Door Left Open Alert"
          4. Configure the inputs:
             - **Door Sensor**: Select your door sensor (e.g., Entry Door)
             - **Alert Media**: Select a media player and the media to play
             - **Open Duration**: Set how long the door should be open before alerting

          **Example configurations:**

          - Garage door left open for 30 minutes → Select garage door sensor + living room speaker + 30 min duration
          - Front door ajar for 5 minutes → Select front door sensor + kitchen speaker + 5 min duration
