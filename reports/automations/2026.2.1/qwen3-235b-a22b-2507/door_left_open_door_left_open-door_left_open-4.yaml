    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
response: |-
  You're describing a blueprint automation for Home Assistant, which involves creating a reusable automation template. Unfortunately, I cannot create or modify blueprints directly as it requires access to the Home Assistant configuration files or UI editor.

  However, I can guide you on how to set this up:

  1. **Create a Blueprint:**
     - Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes > Blueprints > Automation Blueprints** in Home Assistant.
     - Use the following YAML as a starting point:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Alert When Door Left Open
    description: Play an alert on a media player when a door has been left open for a specified duration.
    domain: automation
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: Door Sensor
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
            device_class: opening
      alert_media_player:
        name: Alert Media Player
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: media_player
      alert_sound:
        name: Alert Media
        selector:
          media:
            entity_id: '{{ alert_media_player }}'
      open_duration:
        name: Open Duration
        description: Time the door must be open before alert triggers
        default: "00:30:00"
        selector:
          duration: {}

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"

  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      state: "on"
      for: !input open_duration

  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: !input alert_media_player
      data:
        media_content_id: !input alert_sound
        media_content_type: "audio"
  ```

  2. **How to Use:**
     - After saving this as `automation.door_alert.yaml` in your `blueprints/automation` folder, reload blueprints.
     - Create a new automation using this blueprint.
     - Select the door sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.entry_door`), choose the media player (e.g., `media_player.living_room_speaker`), pick the audio clip, and set your duration (e.g., 5 minutes).

  3. **Notes:**
     - Ensure the media player supports playing local or web-accessible audio files.
     - Audio format should be compatible (e.g., MP3, WAV via URL).
     - Test with short durations initially.

  Let me know if you'd like help troubleshooting or customizing it further!

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          # Door left open

          ## Problem statement

          Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
          left open.

          ## Example use cases

          These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

          - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
          - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

          ## Detailed Description

          The blueprint should accept two inputs:

          | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
          | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
          | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
          | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
          | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

          The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
