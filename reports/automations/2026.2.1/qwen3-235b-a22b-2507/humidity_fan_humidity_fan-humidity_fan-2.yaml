    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.
response: |-
  The request is for a blueprint automation configuration, which involves setting up rules in Home Assistant's configuration (e.g., YAML or UI automation). You cannot create or modify blueprints via this assistant, as it requires configuration-level access.

  However, I can guide you:

  To create this automation:
  1. Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes > Create Automation** in Home Assistant.
  2. Choose **"Start with an empty automation"**.
  3. Add a **state trigger**:
     - Entity: `humidity_sensor` (e.g., `sensor.bathroom_exhaust_fan_humidity`)
     - From: (any)
     - To: above your `humidity_level` (e.g., 60%)
  4. Add a **condition** (to avoid turning on if already on):
     - Condition: Device
     - Device: Your fan device
     - Entity: `fan_entity` (e.g., `fan.bathroom_exhaust_fan`)
     - State: "is not" "on"
  5. Add an action:
     - Action: Turn on `fan_entity`
  6. Create a **second automation** (or use a single automation with dual triggers and conditions):
     - Trigger when humidity goes **below** `humidity_level`
     - Condition: Fan is currently on
     - Action: Turn off the fan

  Alternatively, use **Blueprint > Use a blueprint** and search for community humidity-based fan control templates.

  Let me know if you'd like help checking the current humidity or fan state!

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
