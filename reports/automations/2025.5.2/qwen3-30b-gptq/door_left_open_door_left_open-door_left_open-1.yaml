    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here is a blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is left open:

  ```yaml
  name: "Play alert when door is left open"
  description: "Plays an alert on the speaker when the door is left open for a specified duration."
  input:
    door_sensor:
      name: "Door Sensor"
      selector:
        entity:
          domain: binary_sensor
          device_class: door
    alert_media:
      name: "Alert Media"
      selector:
        media: {}
    open_duration:
      name: "Open Duration"
      selector:
        duration: {}
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: 'open'
      for:
        minutes: !input open_duration
  action:
    - service: media_player/play_media
      target:
        entity_id: !input alert_media

        media_content_id: "alert"
        media_content_type: "audio"
        media_title: "Door Left Open"
  ```

  This blueprint will play the selected media when the specified door sensor detects the door is open for the defined duration.
