    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  ## Vacuum Pause Automation

  ## Overview
  This automation pauses the vacuum when a phone call is detected, and resumes it manually.

  ## Configuration

  ## Automation
  automation:
    sequence:
      - trigger:
          platform: sensor
          entity_id: sensors.phone_call_sensor
      - action:
          service: vacuum.pause
          entity_id: vacuum_entity

  ## Entities

  ## Binary Sensor
  binary_sensor:
    entity_id: sensors.phone_call_sensor
