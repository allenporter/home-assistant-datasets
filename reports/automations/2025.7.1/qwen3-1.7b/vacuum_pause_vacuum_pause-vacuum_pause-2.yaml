    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  ## Vacuum Pause Automation

  ## Overview
  This automation pauses the vacuum when a phone call is detected, and resumes it manually.

  ## Configuration

  ## Sensor
  - A binary sensor to detect phone calls
  - Name: phone_call_sensor
  - Entity: phone_call_sensor
  - State: on = phone call received, off = no phone call

  ## Automation
  - Trigger: When the phone_call_sensor is turned on
  - Condition: The vacuum is running
  - Action: Pause the vacuum

  ## Vacuum Entity
  - Name: vacuum_entity
  - Entity: vacuum
  - State: running

  ## Automation Configuration

  automation:
    sequence:
      - trigger:
          platform: sensor
          sensor: phone_call_sensor
      - condition:
          condition: states.sensor.phone_call_sensor.state == 'on'
          condition: states.vacuum_entity.state == 'running'
      - action:
          service: vacuum.pause
          target: { entity_id: vacuum_entity }
          data:
            pause: true
