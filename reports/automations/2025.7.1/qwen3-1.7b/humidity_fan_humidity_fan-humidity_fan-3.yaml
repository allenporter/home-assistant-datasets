    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  ## Humidity Fan Automation

  ## Blueprint Configuration

  ## Inputs
  - humidity_sensor: A sensor entity that is a humidity sensor that triggers the automation.
  - humidity_level: A number selector to set the value used as the trigger.
  - fan_entity: A fan entity to turn on when the automation fires.

  ## Automation
  - When the humidity_sensor level is above humidity_level, turn on the fan_entity.
  - When the humidity_sensor level is below humidity_level, turn off the fan_entity.
  - Do not turn on the fan if it is already on.
  - Do not turn off the fan if it is already off.

  ## YAML Configuration
  ```yaml
  automation:
    - trigger:
        platform: sensor
        sensor: humidity_sensor
      action:
        service: fan.turn_on
        target: {{ fan_entity }}
        if: state is 'on'
