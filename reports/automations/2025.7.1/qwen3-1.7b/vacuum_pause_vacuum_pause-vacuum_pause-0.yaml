    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  ## Vacuum Pause Automation

  ## Overview
  This automation pauses the vacuum when a phone call is received. It ensures that the vacuum is paused only when a phone call is detected and can be resumed manually.

  ## Configuration

  ### Entities
  - `phone_call_sensor`: A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received.
  - `vacuum_entity`: A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.

  ### Automation
  - Trigger: When `phone_call_sensor` is turned on.
  - Condition: When `vacuum_entity` is in a running state.
  - Action: Pause the `vacuum_entity`.

  ### YAML Configuration
  ```yaml
  automation:
    - trigger:
      - platform: sensor
        - entity_id: sensor.phone_call_sensor
    - condition:
      - condition: custom:vacuum_is_running
        - entity_id: vacuum_entity
    - action:
      - service: vacuum.pause
        - entity_id: vacuum_entity
  ```
  ```yaml
