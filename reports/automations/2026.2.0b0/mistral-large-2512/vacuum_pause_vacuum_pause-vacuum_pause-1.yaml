    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here’s a **blueprint automation** for Home Assistant to pause your vacuum when you receive a phone call:

  ---
  ### **Blueprint: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call**
  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
    description: Pause a vacuum when a phone call is detected.
    domain: automation
    input:
      phone_call_sensor:
        name: Phone Call Sensor
        description: Binary sensor that triggers when a phone call is received.
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
      vacuum_entity:
        name: Vacuum
        description: Vacuum to pause when the phone call starts.
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: vacuum

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
      to: "on"

  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
      state: "cleaning"

  action:
    - service: vacuum.pause
      target:
        entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
  ```

  ---

  ### **How It Works**
  1. **Trigger**: The automation triggers when the `phone_call_sensor` (binary sensor) turns `on`.
  2. **Condition**: Checks if the vacuum is currently `cleaning`.
  3. **Action**: Pauses the vacuum (does not stop it, so you can resume manually later).

  ---

  ### **How to Use**
  1. Save the blueprint code as a `.yaml` file in your Home Assistant `blueprints/automation` folder.
  2. Create a new automation using this blueprint.
  3. Select:
     - Your **phone call sensor** (e.g., a binary sensor from your phone app).
     - Your **vacuum entity**.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
