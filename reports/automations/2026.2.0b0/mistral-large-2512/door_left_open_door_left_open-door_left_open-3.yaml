    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
response: |-
  Here’s a **Home Assistant Blueprint** for your door-left-open alert automation. You can save this as a `.yaml` file in your `blueprints/automation` directory (e.g., `door_left_open_alert.yaml`).

  ---

  ### **Blueprint: Door Left Open Alert**
  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Door Left Open Alert
    description: Play an alert on a speaker when a door is left open for a specified duration.
    domain: automation
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: Door Sensor
        description: The binary_sensor entity for the door.
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
            device_class: door
      alert_media:
        name: Alert Media
        description: The media player and alert sound to play.
        selector:
          media:
            multiple: false
      open_duration:
        name: Open Duration
        description: Time before the alert plays.
        default: "00:05:00"
        selector:
          duration:

  mode: restart
  max_exceeded: silent

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
      for: !input open_duration

  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ alert_media.split('|')[0] }}"
      data:
        media_content_id: "{{ alert_media.split('|')[1] }}"
        media_content_type: "music"
  ```

  ---

  ### **How to Use:**
  1. **Save the Blueprint**:
     - Create a `blueprints/automation` directory in your Home Assistant `config` folder (if it doesn’t exist).
     - Save the YAML above as `door_left_open_alert.yaml`.

  2. **Create the Automation**:
     - Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes**.
     - Click **+ Add Automation** and select **Door Left Open Alert**.
     - Configure:
       - **Door Sensor**: Select your door sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.entry_door`).
       - **Alert Media**: Use the format `media_player.living_room_speaker|media-source://media_source/local/alert.mp3`.
         - Replace `media_player.living_room_speaker` with your speaker entity.
         - Replace `media-source://media_source/local/alert.mp3` with your alert sound file path.
       - **Open Duration**: Set the delay (e.g., 5 minutes).

  3. **Test It**:
     - Open the door and wait for the duration. The alert should play on the selected speaker.

  ---

  ### **Notes:**
  - The `alert_media` input uses the format `media_player_entity|media_id` (e.g., `media_player.kitchen_speaker|media-source://media_source/local/door_alert.mp3`).
  - Ensure your media file is accessible in Home Assistant (e.g., in the `media` directory).

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          # Door left open

          ## Problem statement

          Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
          left open.

          ## Example use cases

          These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

          - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
          - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

          ## Detailed Description

          The blueprint should accept two inputs:

          | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
          | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
          | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
          | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
          | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

          The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

          Here’s a **Home Assistant Blueprint** for your door-left-open alert automation. You can save this as a `.yaml` file in your `blueprints/automation` directory (e.g., `door_left_open_alert.yaml`).

          ---

          ### **Blueprint: Door Left Open Alert**
          ```yaml
          blueprint:
            name: Door Left Open Alert
            description: Play an alert on a speaker when a door is left open for a specified duration.

              to: "on"
              for: !input open_duration

          action:
            - service: media_player.play_media
              target:
                entity_id: "{{ alert_media.split('|')[0] }}"
              data:
                media_content_id: "{{ alert_media.split('|')[1] }}"
                media_content_type: "music"
          ```

          ---

          ### **How to Use:**
          1. **Save the Blueprint**:
             - Create a `blueprints/automation` directory in your Home Assistant `config` folder (if it doesn’t exist).
             - Save the YAML above as `door_left_open_alert.yaml`.

          2. **Create the Automation**:
             - Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes**.
             - Click **+ Add Automation** and select **Door Left Open Alert**.
             - Configure:
               - **Door Sensor**: Select your door sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.entry_door`).
               - **Alert Media**: Use the format `media_player.living_room_speaker|media-source://media_source/local/alert.mp3`.
                 - Replace `media_player.living_room_speaker` with your speaker entity.
                 - Replace `media-source://media_source/local/alert.mp3` with your alert sound file path.
               - **Open Duration**: Set the delay (e.g., 5 minutes).

          3. **Test It**:
             - Open the door and wait for the duration. The alert should play on the selected speaker.

          ---

          ### **Notes:**
          - The `alert_media` input uses the format `media_player_entity|media_id` (e.g., `media_player.kitchen_speaker|media-source://media_source/local/door_alert.mp3`).
          - Ensure your media file is accessible in Home Assistant (e.g., in the `media` directory).
