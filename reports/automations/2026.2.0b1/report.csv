In the Home Assistant UI go to **Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints**.\n2. Click **+ Create Blueprint**, paste the YAML above, and save.\n3. Create a new automation from this blueprint, selecting:\n   * Your humidity sensor (e.g., `sensor.bathroom_exhaust_fan_humidity`),\n   * The humidity level you want as the trigger (e.g., `60`),\n   * The fan you want to control (e.g., `fan.bathroom_exhaust_fan`).\n\nThe automation will now keep the fan running only while the humidity is above the set threshold and will automatically stop it once the humidity falls back below that level.","humidity_fan-test_fan_triggered_off","Good",""

Save the YAML file (e.g., `light_on_door.yaml`) in your **Blueprints** folder (`/config/blueprints/automation/`).\n2. In **Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints**, click **+ CREATE AUTOMATION FROM BLUEPRINT** and select “Light on door open”.\n3. Fill in the three inputs:\n   * **Door sensor** – e.g. `binary_sensor.pantry_door`\n   * **Light(s) to control** – e.g. `light.pantry_light` (you can select multiple lights)\n   * **Timeout** – leave as the default 2 minutes or change it.\n4. Save the automation. It will now turn the selected light(s) on when the door opens, turn them off when the door closes, and also automatically turn them off after the timeout if the door stays open.\n\nFeel free to adapt the trigger states (`'on'`/`'off'`) if your particular sensor uses different values (e.g., `'open'`/`'closed'`). The `mode: restart` line makes sure that if the door opens again while the timeout is running, the timer restarts, keeping the lights on for another full period.","light_on_door-test_light_timeout","Bad","TimeoutError,TimeoutError: Timeout waiting for light to turn on"

The vacuum\nshould be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.\n","","To create this automation, you'll need to use the Home Assistant automation editor or YAML configuration. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n### Steps to Create the Automation:\n\n1. **Define the Inputs:**\n   - `phone_call_sensor`: This is a binary sensor that turns `on` when a phone call is received.\n   - `vacuum_entity`: This is the vacuum entity you want to pause when the phone call is detected.\n\n2. **Create the Automation:**\n   - Use the `binary_sensor` as the trigger.\n   - Add a condition to check if the vacuum is currently running.\n   - Use the `vacuum.pause` service to pause the vacuum when the trigger and condition are met.\n\n### Example YAML Configuration:\n```yaml\nalias: 'Pause Vacuum on Phone Call'\ndescription: 'Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is received'\ntrigger:\n  - platform: state\n    entity_id: binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor\n    to: 'on'\ncondition:\n  - condition: state\n    entity_id: vacuum.vacuum_entity\n    state: 'cleaning'\naction:\n  - service: vacuum.pause\n    entity_id: vacuum.vacuum_entity\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Trigger:** The automation triggers when the `phone_call_sensor` changes to `on`.\n- **Condition:** The automation checks if the vacuum is in the `cleaning` state.\n- **Action:** If both conditions are met, the vacuum is paused using the `vacuum.pause` service.\n\n### Notes:\n- Replace `binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor` and `vacuum.vacuum_entity` with the actual entity IDs from your Home Assistant setup.\n- Ensure your vacuum supports the `pause` service. Some vacuums may only support `stop` or `return_to_base`.\n\n### Using the Blueprint:\nIf you want to create a reusable blueprint for this automation:\n1. Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes > Blueprints**.\n2. Create a new blueprint and paste the YAML configuration above.\n3. Customize the inputs (`phone_call_sensor` and `vacuum_entity`) to make them configurable when using the blueprint.\n\nThis automation will ensure your vacuum pauses during phone calls and can be resumed manually afterward.","vacuum_pause-test_blueprint_inputs","Bad","AssertionError: Blueprint yaml did not contain 'blueprint:' key"

Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n### Steps to Create the Automation:\n\n1. **Define the Inputs:**\n   - `phone_call_sensor`: This is a binary sensor that turns `on` when a phone call is received.\n   - `vacuum_entity`: This is the vacuum entity you want to pause when the phone call is detected.\n\n2. **Create the Automation:**\n   - Use the `binary_sensor` as the trigger.\n   - Add a condition to check if the vacuum is currently running.\n   - Use the `vacuum.pause` service to pause the vacuum when the trigger and condition are met.\n\n### Example YAML Configuration:\n```yaml\nalias: 'Pause Vacuum on Phone Call'\ndescription: 'Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is received'\ntrigger:\n  - platform: state\n    entity_id: binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor\n    to: 'on'\ncondition:\n  - condition: state\n    entity_id: vacuum.vacuum_entity\n    state: 'cleaning'\naction:\n  - service: vacuum.pause\n    entity_id: vacuum.vacuum_entity\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Trigger:** The automation triggers when the `phone_call_sensor` changes to `on`.\n- **Condition:** The automation checks if the vacuum is in the `cleaning` state.\n- **Action:** If both conditions are met, the vacuum is paused using the `vacuum.pause` service.\n\n### Notes:\n- Replace `binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor` and `vacuum.vacuum_entity` with the actual entity IDs from your Home Assistant setup.\n- Ensure your vacuum supports the `pause` service. Some vacuums may only support `stop` or `return_to_base`.\n\n### Using the Blueprint:\nIf you want to create a reusable blueprint for this automation:\n1.

The vacuum\nshould be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.\n","","Here is a ready‑to‑use Home Assistant blueprint that pauses a vacuum when a phone‑call binary sensor becomes **on**.  \n\n```yaml\nblueprint:\n  name: Pause vacuum on phone call\n  description: >-\n    Pauses the selected vacuum when the specified phone‑call sensor\n    goes to the **on** state (e.g. an incoming call).
