"vacuum_pause_vacuum_pause-vacuum_pause-4","mistral-large-2512","vacuum","# Vacuum Pause\n\n## Problem statement\n\nCreate a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.\n\n## Example use cases\n\nThese are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:\n\n- Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives\n- Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts\n\n## Detailed Description\n\nThe blueprint should accept two inputs:\n\n| Input               | Description                                                           |\n| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |\n| `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |\n\nThe automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum\nshould be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.\n","","Here’s a **blueprint automation** for Home Assistant to pause your vacuum when you receive a phone call:\n\n---\n### **Blueprint: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call**\n```yaml\nblueprint:\n  name: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call\n  description: Pause a vacuum when a phone call is detected.\n  domain: automation\n  input:\n    phone_call_sensor:\n      name: Phone Call Sensor\n      description: Binary sensor that triggers when a phone call is received.\n      selector:\n        entity:\n          domain: binary_sensor\n    vacuum_entity:\n      name: Vacuum\n      description: Vacuum to pause when the phone call starts.\n      selector:\n        entity:\n          domain: vacuum\n\ntrigger:\n  - platform: state\n    entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor\n    to: 'on'\n\ncondition:\n  - condition: state\n    entity_id: !input vacuum_entity\n    state: 'cleaning'\n\naction:\n  - service: vacuum.pause\n    target:\n      entity_id: !input vacuum_entity\n```\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**\n1. **Trigger**: The automation runs when the `phone_call_sensor` turns `on`.\n2. **Condition**: It checks if the vacuum is currently `cleaning`.\n3. **Action**: If the vacuum is running, it pauses (not stops) the vacuum.\n\n### **How to Use**\n1. Save the blueprint in your Home Assistant `blueprints/automation` folder.\n2. Create a new automation using this blueprint.\n3. Select:\n   - Your **phone call sensor** (e.g., a binary sensor from your phone app).\n   - Your **vacuum entity** (e.g., `vacuum.your_vacuum_name`).\n4. Save the automation.\n\nNow, your vacuum will pause automatically when you receive a call! Resume it manually when you're done.","vacuum_pause-test_vacuum_not_changed_when_idle","Good",""
