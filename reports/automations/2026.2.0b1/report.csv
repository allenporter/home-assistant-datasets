The automation should not try to\nturn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is\nalready off.\n","","Here’s a simple blueprint automation for turning on a fan based on humidity levels:\n\n### Blueprint Automation: Humidity Fan Control\n\n#### Inputs:\n1. **`humidity_sensor`**: A sensor entity that measures humidity.\n2. **`humidity_level`**: A number input to set the humidity threshold (e.g., 60%).\n3. **`fan_entity`**: A fan entity to control.\n\n#### Automation Logic:\n1. **Trigger**: The automation triggers when the `humidity_sensor` value rises above `humidity_level`.\n2. **Action**: Turn on the `fan_entity` if it is not already on.\n3. **Stop Condition**: The automation stops the fan when the `humidity_sensor` value falls below `humidity_level`.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: The automation checks the fan's state before turning it on or off to avoid unnecessary actions.\n\n#### Example YAML Blueprint:\n```yaml\nblueprint:\n  name: Humidity Fan Control\n  description: Turns on a fan when humidity exceeds a set level.\n  domain: automation\n  input:\n    humidity_sensor:\n      name: Humidity Sensor\n      description: The sensor that measures humidity.\n      selector:\n        entity:\n          domain: sensor\n          device_class: humidity\n    humidity_level:\n      name: Humidity Level\n      description: The humidity threshold to trigger the fan.\n      selector:\n        number:\n          min: 0\n          max: 100\n          unit_of_measurement: '%'\n    fan_entity:\n      name: Fan Entity\n      description: The fan to control.\n      selector:\n        entity:\n          domain: fan\n\ntrigger:\n  - platform: numeric_state\n    entity_id: !input humidity_sensor\n    above: !input humidity_level\n\naction:\n  - service: fan.turn_on\n    target:\n      entity_id: !input fan_entity\n    condition: '{{ state(!input fan_entity) == 'off' }}'\n\n  - wait_for_trigger:\n      platform: numeric_state\n      entity_id: !input humidity_sensor\n      below: !input humidity_level\n\n  - service: fan.turn_off\n    target:\n      entity_id: !input fan_entity\n    condition: '{{ state(!input fan_entity) == 'on' }}'\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n- The automation monitors the `humidity_sensor`.\n- When humidity exceeds `humidity_level`, it turns on the fan (if it's off).\n- When humidity drops below `humidity_level`, it turns off the fan (if it's on).\n\nThis ensures the fan only runs when needed and avoids redundant actions.","humidity_fan-test_fan_triggered_off","Bad","AssertionError: Unable to load automation."

The vacuum\nshould be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.\n","","To create this automation, you'll need to use the Home Assistant automation editor or YAML configuration. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n### Steps to Create the Automation:\n\n1. **Define the Inputs:**\n   - `phone_call_sensor`: This is a binary sensor that turns `on` when a phone call is received.\n   - `vacuum_entity`: This is the vacuum entity you want to pause when the phone call is detected.\n\n2. **Create the Automation:**\n   - Use the `binary_sensor` as the trigger.\n   - Add a condition to check if the vacuum is currently running.\n   - Use the `vacuum.pause` service to pause the vacuum when the trigger and condition are met.\n\n### Example YAML Configuration:\n```yaml\nalias: 'Pause Vacuum on Phone Call'\ndescription: 'Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is received'\ntrigger:\n  - platform: state\n    entity_id: binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor\n    to: 'on'\ncondition:\n  - condition: state\n    entity_id: vacuum.vacuum_entity\n    state: 'cleaning'\naction:\n  - service: vacuum.pause\n    entity_id: vacuum.vacuum_entity\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Trigger:** The automation triggers when the `phone_call_sensor` changes to `on`.\n- **Condition:** The automation checks if the vacuum is in the `cleaning` state.\n- **Action:** If both conditions are met, the vacuum is paused using the `vacuum.pause` service.\n\n### Notes:\n- Replace `binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor` and `vacuum.vacuum_entity` with the actual entity IDs from your Home Assistant setup.\n- Ensure your vacuum supports the `pause` service. Some vacuums may only support `stop` or `return_to_base`.\n\n### Using the Blueprint:\nIf you want to create a reusable blueprint for this automation:\n1. Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes > Blueprints**.\n2. Create a new blueprint and paste the YAML configuration above.\n3. Customize the inputs (`phone_call_sensor` and `vacuum_entity`) to make them configurable when using the blueprint.\n\nThis automation will ensure your vacuum pauses during phone calls and can be resumed manually afterward.","vacuum_pause-test_blueprint_inputs","Bad","AssertionError: Blueprint yaml did not contain 'blueprint:' key"
