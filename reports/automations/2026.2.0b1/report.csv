In **Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints**, click **Import blueprint** and select the file.  \n3. **Create a new automation** from the imported Blueprint and fill in the three inputs:  \n   * **Door sensor** – pick the binary sensor that indicates the door open/closed state (e.g., `binary_sensor.entry_door`).  \n   * **Alert media** – pick the media player that should announce the alert (e.g., `media_player.living_room`).  \n   * **Open duration** – set how long the door must stay open before the alert triggers (e.g., `00:05:00` for 5 minutes).  \n\nWhen the selected door sensor changes to **on** (open), the automation waits the specified duration. If the door is still open after that time, the chosen speaker will play the selected alert.","door_left_open-test_door_open_plays_media","Bad","AssertionError: Unable to load automation."

Click **Create Automation** and fill in the three inputs:  \n   * **Humidity sensor** – e.g. `sensor.bathroom_exhaust_fan_humidity`  \n   * **Humidity threshold** – the percentage you want (e.g. `60`)  \n   * **Fan to control** – e.g. `fan.bathroom_exhaust_fan`\n\nThe generated automation will now keep the fan running only while the humidity is above the chosen level, without sending duplicate *on/off* commands.","humidity_fan-test_fan_triggered_off","Good",""
