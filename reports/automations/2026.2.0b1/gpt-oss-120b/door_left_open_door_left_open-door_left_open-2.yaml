    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here is a reusable Home Assistant blueprint that plays a sound on a chosen media player when a door binary‑sensor remains *on* (open) for a configurable period of time.

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Door left open – alert on speaker
    description: >
      Plays a selected media file (or TTS) on a chosen speaker when a door
      binary sensor stays open longer than a configured duration.
    domain: automation
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: Door sensor
        description: Binary sensor that reports the door state (open = on).
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
      alert_media:

        selector:
          media:

      for: !input open_duration

  condition: []   # No additional conditions required; add your own if needed.

  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      data:
        entity_id: !input alert_media
        # You can replace the below with a specific media URL, a TTS service, etc.
        # Example using TTS:
        #   media_content_id: >-
        #     {{ "The front door has been left open for " ~ (states('' + input_open_duration + '') | int) ~ " seconds." }}
        #   media_content_type: "music"
      # If you only need to trigger a TTS service, replace the service call with:
      # - service: tts.google_translate_say
      #   data:
      #     entity_id: !input alert_media
      #     message: "The door has been left open."

  mode: single
  ```

  ### How to use the blueprint
  1. Save the YAML above as a file (e.g., `door_open_alert.yaml`) in your `blueprints/automation/` folder.
  2. In Home Assistant UI go to **Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints** and import the file.
  3. When creating a new automation from this blueprint, select:
     - **Door sensor** – the binary sensor representing the door (e.g., `binary_sensor.entry_door`).
     - **Alert media** – the media player to use for the alert (e.g., `media_player.living_room_smart_speaker`).
     - **Open duration** – how long the door must stay open before the alert fires (e.g., `00:05:00` for five minutes).

  Feel free to adjust the `action` section to use a specific sound file, a TTS message, or any other media you prefer.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
          left open.

          ## Example use cases

          These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

          - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
          - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

          ## Detailed Description

          The blueprint should accept two inputs:

          | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
          | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
          | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
          | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
          | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

          The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
