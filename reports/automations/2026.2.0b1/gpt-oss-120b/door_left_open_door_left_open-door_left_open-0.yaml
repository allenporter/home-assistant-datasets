    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
response: |-
  Here is a reusable **Blueprint** that will play a selected media item on a chosen speaker when a door (or any binary sensor) remains `on` (open) for a configurable amount of time.

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Door left open – play alert
    description: >
      Plays a chosen media item on a media player when a door (binary sensor)
      stays open for a defined period. The blueprint can be used for any
      door‑like sensor and any speaker/media player.
    domain: automation
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: Door sensor
        description: The binary sensor that reports the door state (open = on).
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
            device_class: door
      alert_media:
        name: Alert media
        description: Media player and media to play when the door is left open.
        selector:
          media:
      open_duration:
        name: Open duration
        description: Time the door must stay open before the alert fires.
        selector:
          duration:

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
      for: !input open_duration

  condition:
    # Optional – make sure the sensor is still on when the action runs
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      state: "on"

  action:
    # Play the selected media on the chosen media player
    - service: media_player.play_media
      data:
        entity_id: "{{ alert_media.entity_id }}"
        media_content_id: "{{ alert_media.media_content_id }}"
        media_content_type: "{{ alert_media.media_content_type }}"

  mode: single
  ```

  ### How to use the blueprint

  1. **Save the YAML** as a file (e.g., `door_open_alert.yaml`) and place it in your Home Assistant `blueprints/automation` folder, or add it via **Settings → Blueprints → Import blueprint**.
  2. When creating a new automation from this blueprint, you’ll be asked to select:
     * **Door sensor** – choose the binary sensor that reports the door (e.g., `binary_sensor.entry_door`).
     * **Alert media** – pick the media player (e.g., `media_player.living_room_smart_speaker`) and the media you want to play (you can browse your music library, select a TTS message, etc.).
     * **Open duration** – specify how long the door needs to stay open before the alert triggers (e.g., `00:05:00` for 5 minutes).

  The automation will now monitor the selected door sensor and, if it remains open for the configured time, it will send the chosen media to the target speaker. Adjust the **mode**, **conditions**, or **action** as needed for your specific use case.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          # Door left open

          ## Problem statement

          Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
          left open.

          ## Example use cases

          These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

          - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
          - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

          ## Detailed Description

          The blueprint should accept two inputs:

          | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
          | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
          | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
          | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
          | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

          The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

          2. When creating a new automation from this blueprint, you’ll be asked to select:
             * **Door sensor** – choose the binary sensor that reports the door (e.g., `binary_sensor.entry_door`).
             * **Alert media** – pick the media player (e.g., `media_player.living_room_smart_speaker`) and the media you want to play (you can browse your music library, select a TTS message, etc.).
             * **Open duration** – specify how long the door needs to stay open before the alert triggers (e.g., `00:05:00` for 5 minutes).

          The automation will now monitor the selected door sensor and, if it remains open for the configured time, it will send the chosen media to the target speaker. Adjust the **mode**, **conditions**, or **action** as needed for your specific use case.
