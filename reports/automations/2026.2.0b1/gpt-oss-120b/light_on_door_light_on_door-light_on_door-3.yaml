    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Here is a ready‑to‑use **Blueprint** that turns a light (or lights) on when a door sensor opens and turns it off again when the door closes or after a 2‑minute timeout.

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Light on door open
    description: Turn on one or more lights when a door (binary_sensor) opens and turn them off when it closes or after a timeout.
    domain: automation
    source_url: https://github.com/your-repo/blueprints   # optional – replace with your own URL
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: Door sensor
        description: Binary sensor that detects the door opening/closing.
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
      light_switch:
        name: Light(s) to control
        description: Light(s) that should be turned on when the door opens.
        selector:
          target:
            entity:
              domain: light
      timeout:
        name: Timeout (seconds)
        description: Time after which the light will be turned off if the door stays open.
        default: 120
        selector:
          number:
            min: 0
            max: 3600
            unit_of_measurement: seconds

  mode: restart   # ensures a new timer replaces any existing one

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"                     # door opened (binary_sensor = on)

  action:
    - choose:
        - conditions:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: !input door_sensor
              state: "on"
          sequence:
            # Turn the light(s) on immediately
            - service: light.turn_on
              target: !input light_switch

            # Wait for the door to close OR the timeout, whichever comes first
            - wait_for_trigger:
                - platform: state
                  entity_id: !input door_sensor
                  to: "off"
            - timeout: !input timeout

            # After the wait, turn the light(s) off
            - service: light.turn_off
              target: !input light_switch
      default: []
  ```

  ### How to use the blueprint
  1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Blueprints → Create Blueprint** and paste the YAML above.
  2. Save the blueprint (give it a name you like).
  3. Create a new automation from this blueprint:
     - Choose the door sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.pantry_door`).
     - Choose the light(s) to control (e.g., `light.pantry_light`).
     - Optionally adjust the timeout (default is 120 seconds = 2 minutes).

  The automation will:
  - Turn the selected light(s) on as soon as the door opens.
  - Keep them on while the door stays open.
  - Turn the light(s) off either when the door closes or after the configured timeout, whichever occurs first.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
