    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Here is a ready‑to‑use Home Assistant Blueprint that does exactly what you described – turn a light on when a door (binary sensor) opens, turn it off when the door closes **or** after a 2‑minute timeout.

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Light on door open
    description: >
      Turn on one or more lights when a door‑sensor opens and turn them off
      when the door closes or after a configurable timeout.

        default: 00:02:00
        selector:
          duration:

  mode: restart   # restart the automation if the door opens again while waiting

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"          # most binary sensors use 'on' for open

      to: "off"         # 'off' for closed

  condition: []       # no extra conditions

  action:
    - choose:
        # Door opened → turn lights on and start timer to turn them off
        - conditions:
            - condition: trigger
              id: "open"
          sequence:
            - service: light.turn_on
              target: !input light_switch
            - wait_for_trigger:
                - platform: state
                  entity_id: !input door_sensor

              continue_on_timeout: true
            - service: light.turn_off
              target: !input light_switch

        # Door closed → turn lights off immediately (cancels any waiting timer)
        - conditions:
            - condition: trigger
              id: "close"
          sequence:
            - service: light.turn_off
              target: !input light_switch
      default: []   # should never hit this

  # Optional: you can expose the timeout as an input if you want the user to
  # customise it per‑instance, otherwise hard‑code "00:02:00" above.
  ```

  ### How to use the blueprint

  1. Save the YAML file (e.g., `light_on_door.yaml`) in your **Blueprints** folder (`/config/blueprints/automation/`).
  2. In **Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints**, click **+ CREATE AUTOMATION FROM BLUEPRINT** and select “Light on door open”.
  3. Fill in the three inputs:
     * **Door sensor** – e.g. `binary_sensor.pantry_door`
     * **Light(s) to control** – e.g. `light.pantry_light` (you can select multiple lights)
     * **Timeout** – leave as the default 2 minutes or change it.
  4. Save the automation. It will now turn the selected light(s) on when the door opens, turn them off when the door closes, and also automatically turn them off after the timeout if the door stays open.

  Feel free to adapt the trigger states (`"on"`/`"off"`) if your particular sensor uses different values (e.g., `"open"`/`"closed"`). The `mode: restart` line makes sure that if the door opens again while the timeout is running, the timer restarts, keeping the lights on for another full period.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          ```

          ### How to use the blueprint

          1. Save the YAML file (e.g., `light_on_door.yaml`) in your **Blueprints** folder (`/config/blueprints/automation/`).
          2. In **Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints**, click **+ CREATE AUTOMATION FROM BLUEPRINT** and select “Light on door open”.
          3. Fill in the three inputs:
             * **Door sensor** – e.g. `binary_sensor.pantry_door`
             * **Light(s) to control** – e.g. `light.pantry_light` (you can select multiple lights)
             * **Timeout** – leave as the default 2 minutes or change it.
          4. Save the automation. It will now turn the selected light(s) on when the door opens, turn them off when the door closes, and also automatically turn them off after the timeout if the door stays open.

          Feel free to adapt the trigger states (`"on"`/`"off"`) if your particular sensor uses different values (e.g., `"open"`/`"closed"`). The `mode: restart` line makes sure that if the door opens again while the timeout is running, the timer restarts, keeping the lights on for another full period.
