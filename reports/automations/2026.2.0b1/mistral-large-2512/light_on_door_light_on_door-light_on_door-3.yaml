    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

  Here’s a **blueprint automation** for Home Assistant that turns on a light when a door opens and turns it off when the door closes or after a 2-minute timeout:

  ### **Blueprint YAML**
  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Door Sensor Light Control
    description: Turn on a light when a door opens, and turn it off when the door closes or after a 2-minute timeout.
    domain: automation
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: Door Sensor
        description: The binary_sensor that triggers the automation.
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
            device_class: door
      light_switch:
        name: Light(s)
        description: The light(s) to turn on/off.
        selector:
          target:
            domain: light
      timeout:
        name: Timeout (minutes)
        description: Time to wait before turning off the light if the door remains open.
        default: 2
        selector:
          number:
            min: 1
            max: 60
            unit_of_measurement: minutes

  mode: restart
  max_exceeded: silent

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"  # Door opens
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "off"  # Door closes
      for:
        hours: 0
        minutes: !input timeout
        seconds: 0

  action:
    - choose:
        - conditions:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: !input door_sensor
              state: "on"
          sequence:
            - service: light.turn_on
              target: !input light_switch
        - conditions:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: !input door_sensor
              state: "off"
          sequence:
            - service: light.turn_off
              target: !input light_switch
  ```

  ---

  ### **How It Works**
  1. **Inputs**:
     - `door_sensor`: A binary sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.pantry_door`) that detects door open/close events.
     - `light_switch`: The light(s) to control (e.g., `light.pantry_light`).
     - `timeout`: Adjustable delay (default: 2 minutes) before turning off the light if the door stays open.

  2. **Triggers**:
     - When the door opens (`to: "on"`), the light turns on.
     - When the door closes (`to: "off"`), the light turns off immediately.
     - If the door stays open, the light turns off after the timeout.

  3. **Actions**:
     - Uses `choose` to check the door state and turn the light on/off accordingly.

  ---

  ### **Example Usage**
  For your **pantry door** use case:
  1. Select `binary_sensor.pantry_door` as the `door_sensor`.
  2. Select `light.pantry_light` as the `light_switch`.
  3. Set the timeout (e.g., 2 minutes).

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
