    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.
response: |-
  I'm unable to create blueprint automations directly, but I can guide you on how to set it up in Home Assistant. Here's how you can create the automation:

  1. **Create a new automation**:
     - Go to **Settings** > **Automations & Scenes** > **Automations** > **Create Automation**.

  2. **Set up the trigger**:
     - Choose **Device** as the trigger type.
     - Select the `binary_sensor` that detects your phone call (e.g., `binary_sensor.phone_call_sensor`).
     - Set the trigger to fire when the sensor turns **on**.

  3. **Add a condition**:
     - Add a condition to check if the vacuum is running.
     - Use the **State** condition and select your vacuum entity (e.g., `vacuum.vacuum_cleaner`).
     - Set the condition to check if the state is **cleaning**.

  4. **Add the action**:
     - Choose **Call Service** as the action.
     - Select the `vacuum.pause` service.
     - Choose the vacuum entity (e.g., `vacuum.vacuum_cleaner`).

  5. **Save the automation**:
     - Give it a name like "Pause Vacuum on Phone Call" and save it.

  This automation will pause the vacuum whenever you receive a phone call while it's running. You can manually resume the vacuum later.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
