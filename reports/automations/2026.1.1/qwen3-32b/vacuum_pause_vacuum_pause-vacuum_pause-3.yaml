    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  I cannot create blueprints directly, but I can guide you on how to create one. Here's a step-by-step process to set up the automation in Home Assistant:

  1. **Go to the Automations section** in your Home Assistant dashboard.
  2. Click on **Create Automation** and choose **Blueprint**.
  3. Fill in the name and description for your blueprint.
  4. Define the inputs:
     - `phone_call_sensor`: Choose a binary sensor that triggers when a phone call is received.
     - `vacuum_entity`: Select the vacuum cleaner entity you want to pause when the automation fires.
  5. Set the trigger to activate when the binary sensor is triggered.
  6. Add a condition to check if the vacuum is running.
  7. Add an action to pause the vacuum using the `HassTurnOff` function.

  Here is a sample YAML configuration for the blueprint:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
    description: Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is received.
    inputs:
      phone_call_sensor:
        name: Phone Call Sensor
        description: A binary sensor entity that triggers when a phone call is received.
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
      vacuum_entity:
        name: Vacuum Entity
        description: A vacuum entity to pause when the automation fires.
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: vacuum
    mode: single
    triggers:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
        to: 'on'
    conditions:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
        state: 'cleaning'
    actions:
      - service: vacuum.pause
        target:
          entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
  ```

  You can use this blueprint to create an automation that pauses your vacuum when you receive a phone call. Make sure to replace the entity IDs with the appropriate ones from your Home Assistant setup.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
