    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

  I cannot create blueprints directly, but I can guide you on how to create one in Home Assistant.

  Here's a step-by-step guide to create the automation blueprint:

  1. **Go to the "Automations & Scenes" section** in Home Assistant.

  2. **Click on "Create Automation"** and choose "Start from scratch."

  3. **Set the trigger**:
     - Click on "Add Trigger."
     - Choose "Event" and select the `door_sensor` binary sensor (e.g., "Pantry Door").
     - Set the condition to "is on" or "opens."

  4. **Set the action to turn on the light**:
     - Click on "Add Action."
     - Choose "Turn on" and select the `light_switch` (e.g., "Pantry Light").

  5. **Add a condition to turn off the light**:
     - Click on "Add Condition."
     - Choose "Time" and set it to "after 2 minutes."

  6. **Set the action to turn off the light**:
     - Click on "Add Action."
     - Choose "Turn off" and select the same `light_switch` (e.g., "Pantry Light").

  7. **Add a condition for when the door closes**:
     - Click on "Add Condition."
     - Choose "Event" and select the `door_sensor` binary sensor (e.g., "Pantry Door").
     - Set the condition to "is off" or "closes."

  8. **Set the action to turn off the light when the door closes**:
     - Click on "Add Action."
     - Choose "Turn off" and select the `light_switch` (e.g., "Pantry Light").

  9. **Save the automation** and give it a name like "Light on Door Open."

  This automation will turn on the light when the door opens, and it will turn off either when the door closes or after 2 minutes, whichever happens first.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
