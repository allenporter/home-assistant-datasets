    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
response: |-
  To create the blueprint automation, you can use the following structure in your Home Assistant configuration:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: "Door Left Open Alert"
    description: "Plays an alert on a media player when a door has been left open for a specified duration."
    domain: automation
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: "Door Sensor"
        description: "The binary sensor that detects the door state."
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
      alert_media:
        name: "Alert Media"
        description: "The media to play on the media player when the alert is triggered."
        selector:
          media:
            domain: media_player
      open_duration:
        name: "Open Duration"
        description: "The duration the door must be open before the alert is triggered."
        selector:
          duration: {}
    variables:
      door_sensor: !input door_sensor
      alert_media: !input alert_media
      open_duration: !input open_duration

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
      for:
        minutes: !input open_duration
        seconds: 0

  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: !input alert_media
      data:
        media_content_id: "https://example.com/alert.mp3"
        media_content_type: "music"
  ```

  ### Explanation:

  1. **Inputs**:
     - `door_sensor`: This is the binary sensor that detects whether the door is open (`on`) or closed (`off`).
     - `alert_media`: This is the media player entity where the alert will be played.
     - `open_duration`: This is the duration the door must be open before the alert is triggered.

  2. **Trigger**:
     - The automation is triggered when the `door_sensor` changes to `on` and stays that way for the specified `open_duration`.

  3. **Action**:
     - The action uses the `media_player.play_media` service to play the alert media on the specified `alert_media` entity.
     - Replace `"https://example.com/alert.mp3"` with the actual URL or path to your alert sound.

  ### Example Use Cases:

  - **Garage Door Alert**:
    - Set `door_sensor` to your garage door binary sensor.
    - Set `alert_media` to your living room speaker.
    - Set `open_duration` to 30 minutes.

  - **Front Door Alert**:
    - Set `door_sensor` to your front door binary sensor.
    - Set `alert_media` to your kitchen Bluetooth speaker.
    - Set `open_duration` to 5 minutes.

  This blueprint will help you monitor doors and provide timely alerts when they are left open for too long.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          # Door left open

          ## Problem statement

          Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
          left open.

          ## Example use cases

          These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

          - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
          - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

          ## Detailed Description

          The blueprint should accept two inputs:

          | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
          | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
          | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
          | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
          | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

          The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

          ### Explanation:

          1. **Inputs**:
             - `door_sensor`: This is the binary sensor that detects whether the door is open (`on`) or closed (`off`).
             - `alert_media`: This is the media player entity where the alert will be played.
             - `open_duration`: This is the duration the door must be open before the alert is triggered.

          2. **Trigger**:
             - The automation is triggered when the `door_sensor` changes to `on` and stays that way for the specified `open_duration`.

          3. **Action**:
             - The action uses the `media_player.play_media` service to play the alert media on the specified `alert_media` entity.
             - Replace `"https://example.com/alert.mp3"` with the actual URL or path to your alert sound.

          ### Example Use Cases:

          - **Garage Door Alert**:
            - Set `door_sensor` to your garage door binary sensor.
            - Set `alert_media` to your living room speaker.
            - Set `open_duration` to 30 minutes.

          - **Front Door Alert**:
            - Set `door_sensor` to your front door binary sensor.
            - Set `alert_media` to your kitchen Bluetooth speaker.
            - Set `open_duration` to 5 minutes.

          This blueprint will help you monitor doors and provide timely alerts when they are left open for too long.
