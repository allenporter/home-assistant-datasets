    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  I can help you create this blueprint automation. Here's a step-by-step guide to set it up:

  ### Blueprint Automation for Humidity-Based Fan Control

  1. **Blueprint Inputs**:
     - `humidity_sensor`: A humidity sensor entity.
     - `humidity_level`: A numeric value representing the threshold humidity.
     - `fan_entity`: The fan entity to control.

  2. **Automation Logic**:
     - When the humidity level rises above the specified threshold, the fan is turned on.
     - When the humidity level drops below the threshold, the fan is turned off.
     - The automation will ensure the fan is only turned on if it's off, and only turned off if it's on.

  Here's how you can define the blueprint in your Home Assistant configuration:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Humidity-Based Fan Control
    description: "Turns on a fan when humidity exceeds a certain level and turns it off when humidity drops below that level."
    domain: automation
    inputs:
      humidity_sensor:
        name: Humidity Sensor
        description: "A humidity sensor entity."
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: sensor
      humidity_level:
        name: Humidity Level
        description: "The humidity level that triggers the fan."
        selector:
          number:
            min: 0
            max: 100
      fan_entity:
        name: Fan Entity
        description: "A fan entity to control."
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: fan

  automations:
    - alias: "Turn on fan when humidity is high"
      description: "Turns on the fan when the humidity is above the threshold."
      trigger:
        - platform: numeric_state
          entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
          above: !input humidity_level
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: !input fan_entity
          state: "off"
      action:
        - service: fan.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: !input fan_entity

    - alias: "Turn off fan when humidity is low"
      description: "Turns off the fan when the humidity is below the threshold."
      trigger:
        - platform: numeric_state
          entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
          below: !input humidity_level
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: !input fan_entity
          state: "on"
      action:
        - service: fan.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: !input fan_entity
  ```

  ### Explanation:
  - **Inputs**: The blueprint defines three inputs: the humidity sensor, the humidity level threshold, and the fan entity to control.
  - **Automation 1**: This automation turns the fan on when the humidity level rises above the specified threshold and the fan is off.
  - **Automation 2**: This automation turns the fan off when the humidity level drops below the threshold and the fan is on.

  ### Example Use Case
  To use this blueprint for the bathroom exhaust fan:
  1. Set `humidity_sensor` to `Bathroom Exhaust Fan Humidity`.
  2. Set `humidity_level` to `60%`.
  3. Set `fan_entity` to `Bathroom Exhaust Fan`.

  This setup ensures that the fan is turned on when the bathroom humidity exceeds 60% and turned off when it drops below that level.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
