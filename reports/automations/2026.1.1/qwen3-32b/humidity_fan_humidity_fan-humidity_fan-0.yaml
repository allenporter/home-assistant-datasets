    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.
response: |-
  I can help you create the automation blueprint for this scenario. Here's a YAML-based blueprint automation to achieve this functionality:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: "Humidity Fan Automation"
    description: "Turn on a fan when humidity exceeds a certain level and turn it off when it drops below."
    input:
      humidity_sensor:
        name: "Humidity Sensor"
        description: "The humidity sensor entity that will trigger the automation."
        selector:
          sensor:
            filter:
              device_class: humidity
      humidity_level:
        name: "Humidity Level"
        description: "The humidity level (in percentage) that will trigger the automation."
        selector:
          number:
            min: 0
            max: 100
            unit_of_measurement: "%"
      fan_entity:
        name: "Fan Entity"
        description: "The fan entity to control based on humidity."
        selector:
          fan: {}

  automations:
    - alias: "Turn on fan when humidity is high"
      description: "Turns on the fan if humidity is above the set level."
      trigger:
        - platform: numeric_state
          above: !input humidity_level
          entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: !input fan_entity
          state: "off"
      action:
        - service: hass.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: !input fan_entity

    - alias: "Turn off fan when humidity is low"
      description: "Turns off the fan if humidity is below the set level."
      trigger:
        - platform: numeric_state
          below: !input humidity_level
          entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: !input fan_entity
          state: "on"
      action:
        - service: hass.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: !input fan_entity
  ```

  ### How it works:

  1. **Inputs**:
     - `humidity_sensor`: Select the humidity sensor that will monitor the environment.
     - `humidity_level`: Set the threshold humidity level (e.g., 60%) to trigger the fan.
     - `fan_entity`: Select the fan that you want to control.

  2. **Automation Logic**:
     - The automation has two parts:
       - **Turn on fan**: If the humidity is above the set level, the fan is turned on **only if it is not already on**.
       - **Turn off fan**: If the humidity drops below the set level, the fan is turned off **only if it is not already off**.

  3. **Use Cases**:
     - You can use this blueprint in the bathroom to turn on the exhaust fan when humidity is too high.
     - You can also use it in the garage to prevent excessive humidity buildup.

  To use this blueprint in Home Assistant, copy and paste the above YAML code into your `blueprints` directory or use the Home Assistant UI to create a new automation blueprint.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
