    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
response: |-
  Here's a blueprint automation that plays an alert on a speaker when a door has been left open for a specified duration:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: "Door Left Open Alert"
    description: "Plays an alert on a media player when a door has been left open for a specified duration."
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: "Door Sensor"
        description: "The binary sensor that detects if the door is open."
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
      alert_media:
        name: "Alert Media"
        description: "The media to play when the door is left open for the specified duration."
        selector:
          media:
            domain: media_player
      open_duration:
        name: "Open Duration"
        description: "The amount of time the door needs to be open before playing the alert."
        selector:
          duration:
            min: 1
            max: 1440
            step: 1
            unit: minutes

  automations:
    - alias: "Door Left Open Alert"
      trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: !input door_sensor
          to: "on"
      condition:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: !input door_sensor
          state: "on"
          for:
            minutes: !input open_duration
      action:
        - service: media_player.play_media
          target:
            entity_id: !input alert_media
          data:
            media_content_id: "https://your-alert-sound.mp3"
            media_content_type: "music"
  ```

  In this blueprint:

  - `door_sensor` is the binary sensor that detects if the door is open.
  - `alert_media` is the media player and media ID for the alert sound.
  - `open_duration` is the duration the door must be open before the alert is played.

  The automation is triggered when the door sensor changes to an "on" state (indicating the door is open). It then checks if the door has been open for the specified duration. If so, it plays the alert sound on the specified media player.

  You can customize the `media_content_id` to point to your desired alert sound.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          # Door left open

          ## Problem statement

          Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
          left open.

          ## Example use cases

          These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

          - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
          - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

          ## Detailed Description

          The blueprint should accept two inputs:

          | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
          | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
          | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
          | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
          | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

          The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
