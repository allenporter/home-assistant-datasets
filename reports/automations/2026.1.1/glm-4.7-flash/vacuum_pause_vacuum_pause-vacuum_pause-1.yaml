    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

          1.  **Analyze the Request:**
              *   **Goal:** Create a Home Assistant Blueprint automation.
              *   **Trigger:** A specific `binary_sensor` entity representing a phone call (starts).
              *   **Condition:** The vacuum entity is currently running.
              *   **Action:** Pause the vacuum entity.
              *   **Constraint:** Keep it simple, plain text.

          2.  **Determine the Blueprint Structure:**
              *   A Home Assistant blueprint typically starts with the header (`blueprint:`).
              *   It needs a `alias`.
              *   It needs an `trigger` section.
              *   It needs an `condition` section (optional but good practice here to check if the vacuum is actually running, though the prompt implies checking if it *is* running).
              *   It needs an `action` section (pause the vacuum).

          3.  **Drafting the Content:**

              *   *Trigger:* The input variable `phone_call_sensor` changes to `true`. Wait, usually phone call sensors are "on" (1) when a call is ringing or incoming. The prompt says "trigger when a binary sensor fires". Let's assume a generic state change. However, most phone call sensors stay on until the call ends. The prompt says "when I receive a phone call", which usually means the start. If I use `on:`, it triggers on both start and end. If I use `state: true`, it might trigger multiple times.
              *   *Refining Trigger:* The prompt example says "when I get a phone call". The standard behavior is usually triggered when the state becomes "On". I'll use `platform: state` and set `to: "on"`.
              *   *Condition:* `vacuum_entity` must be `state: "vacuuming"`. This ensures we don't try to pause a vacuum that is already docked or stopped.
              *   *Action:* `service: vacuum.pause` using the `vacuum_entity` input variable.

          4.  **Constructing the YAML:**

              ```yaml
              blueprint:
                name: Vacuum Pause on Phone Call
                description: Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is detected.
                domain: automation
                input:
                  phone_call_sensor:
                    name: Phone Call Sensor
                    description: Binary sensor that triggers on incoming calls.
                    selector:
                      entity:
                        domain: binary_sensor
                  vacuum_entity:
                    name: Vacuum
                    description: The vacuum entity to pause.
                    selector:
                      entity:
                        domain: vacuum
                trigger:
                  - platform: state
                    entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
                    to: "on"
                condition:
                  - platform: state
                    entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
                    state: "vacuuming"
                action:
                  - service: vacuum.pause
                    entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
              ```

          5.  **Review against Constraints:**
              *   *Answer in plain text?* Yes.
              *   *Keep it simple?* Yes, standard YAML.
              *   *Inputs correct?* `phone_call_sensor` and `vacuum_entity` included.
              *   *Trigger/Condition/Action logic correct?* Yes, triggers on call (ON), checks vacuum is running (vacuuming), pauses it.

          6.  **Final Output Generation:** (Presenting the YAML clearly).
