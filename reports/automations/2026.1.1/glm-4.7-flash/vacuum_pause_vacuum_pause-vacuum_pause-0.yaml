    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

          1.  **Analyze the Request:**
              *   **Goal:** Create a Home Assistant blueprint automation.
              *   **Trigger:** A phone call (detected by a binary sensor).
              *   **Action:** Pause the vacuum.
              *   **Conditions:** The vacuum must be currently running.
              *   **Entities:**
                  *   Input: `phone_call_sensor` (binary_sensor).
                  *   Input: `vacuum_entity` (vacuum).
              *   **Constraint:** The vacuum should be paused, not stopped. It should be resumable.
              *   **Output Format:** Plain text, simple and to the point.

          2.  **Determine the Components of the Blueprint:**
              *   **`alias`**: A human-readable name (e.g., "Pause Vacuum on Phone Call").
              *   **`trigger`**:
                  *   Event: `binary_sensor_state`.
                  *   Platform: `state`.
                  *   Entity ID: `phone_call_sensor`.
                  *   To State: `on`.
              *   **`condition`**:
                  *   To ensure we don't pause an idle vacuum or an already paused one (though the prompt says "when I receive a phone call... don't interrupt my work video conference", implying the vacuum *is* running).
                  *   Type: `state`.
                  *   Entity ID: `vacuum_entity`.
                  *   State: `vacuuming`.
              *   **`action`**:
                  *   Action type: `service`.
                  *   Service domain: `vacuum`.
                  *   Service: `pause`.

          3.  **Drafting the Code:**

              ```yaml
              blueprints:
                - id: pause_vacuum_on_phone_call
                  alias: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
                  description: Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is detected and the vacuum is running.
                  trigger:
                    - platform: state
                      entity_id: phone_call_sensor
                      to: "on"
                  condition:
                    - platform: state
                      entity_id: vacuum_entity
                      state: "vacuuming"
                  action:
                    - service: vacuum.pause
                      target:
                        entity_id: vacuum_entity
                  mode: single
              ```

          4.  **Refining the Blueprint:**
              *   The prompt asks for a "blueprint automation". In Home Assistant, this usually means a YAML block that can be imported, but often users just want the YAML definition for the `automations.yaml` file or the Blueprint UI JSON/YAML. I will provide the YAML definition that fits into a `blueprint:` block.
              *   The inputs are `phone_call_sensor` and `vacuum_entity`.
              *   The trigger is when the sensor is 'on'.
              *   The condition is when the vacuum is 'vacuuming'.
              *   The action is `vacuum.pause`.

          5.  **Formatting the Output:**
              *   Keep it simple.
              *   Use YAML format.
              *   Ensure placeholders are clear (though the prompt defined specific variable names).

          6.  **Final Code Structure:**

              ```yaml
              blueprints:
                - id: "pause_vacuum_on_phone_call"
                  alias: "Pause Vacuum on Phone Call"
                  description: "Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is detected and the vacuum is running."
                  trigger:
                    - platform: state
                      entity_id: phone_call_sensor
                      to: "on"
                  condition:
                    - platform: state
                      entity_id: vacuum_entity
                      state: "vacuuming"
                  action:
                    - service: vacuum.pause
                      target:
                        entity_id: vacuum_entity
                  mode: single
              ```

          7.  **Review against Constraints:**
              *   Pause vacuum? Yes.
              *   On phone call? Yes.
              *   Vacuum running? Yes (condition).
              *   Not stopped (can be resumed)? Yes, `vacuum.pause` is the correct service.

          8.  **Final Output Generation:** (Produce the YAML block).
