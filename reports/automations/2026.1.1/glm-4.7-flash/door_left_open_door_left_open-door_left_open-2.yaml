    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

          The user wants a blueprint for Home Assistant that triggers an alert when a door is left open.

          **Requirements:**
          1.  **Trigger:** A binary sensor state change (open/closed).
          2.  **Condition:** The door state must be `open`.
          3.  **Delay:** Wait for a specific duration (`open_duration`) after the door opens.
          4.  **Action:** Play a specific media file (`alert_media`) on a specific media player.
          5.  **Inputs:** Needs three inputs: `door_sensor`, `alert_media`, `open_duration`.

          **Input details:**
          *   `door_sensor`: `entity` (Binary Sensor).
          *   `alert_media`: `media` (Player + Media ID).
          *   `open_duration`: `duration`.

          **Drafting the Blueprint structure:**

          ```yaml
          blueprint:
            name: Door Left Open Alert
            description: Play an alert on the speaker when the door is left open.
            domain: automation
            input:
              door_sensor:
                name: Door Sensor
                selector:
                  entity:
                    domain: binary_sensor
              alert_media:
                name: Alert Media
                selector:
                  media: # Home Assistant 2024.4+ uses 'media' selector, older versions might use 'media_player' and 'media_id' separately. I will use the modern selector.
              open_duration:
                name: Open Duration
                selector:
                  duration:

            trigger:
              - platform: state
                entity_id: !input door_sensor
                to: 'on'

            condition:
              - condition: template
                value_template: "{{ states[!input door_sensor].state == 'on' }}"

            action:
              - delay: !input open_duration
              - service: media_player.play_media
                data:
                  entity_id: !input alert_media
                  media_content_id: !input alert_media
          ```

          **Refining the Template Condition:**
          The trigger platform `state` `to: 'on'` is the trigger. But usually, we want to ensure the *current* state is actually open.
          If the trigger is `state: open`, and we have a delay, the state might change during the delay.
          The condition should check the *current* state of the sensor.

          Actually, the trigger `state: on` handles the *start* of the timeout.
          The condition `{{ states[!input door_sensor].state == 'on' }}` checks the current state before the action runs. This is a good safety check.

          **Handling the Alert Media Selector:**
          The prompt specifies `alert_media` selector type is `media`.
          In modern Home Assistant (2024.4+), the `media` selector returns a dictionary with keys `entity_id` and `media_id`.
          So `!input alert_media` will resolve to something like `{'entity_id': 'media_player.kitchen', 'media_id': 'sound:alarm'}`.

          When calling `media_player.play_media`, the `entity_id` goes into `data`, and `media_content_id` goes into `data`.
          So the action becomes:
          ```yaml
              - service: media_player.play_media
                data:
                  entity_id: !input alert_media.entity_id
                  media_content_id: !input alert_media.media_id
          ```

          **Final Polish:**
          I will provide the blueprint code in a markdown block.

          Structure:
          1.  YAML header.
          2.  Description.
          3.  Domain.
          4.  Input section.
          5.  Trigger section.
          6.  Condition section.
          7.  Action section.

          Let's double-check the specific selector types requested.
          `door_sensor`: `entity` (domain `binary_sensor` implicitly or explicitly? Prompt says "A binary_sensor entity selector". Explicit is better).
          `alert_media`: `media`.
          `open_duration`: `duration`.

          Looks correct.

          One edge case: What if the user selects a "on" value that isn't exactly "on" (e.g. "open" string)? Most binary sensors use "on" or "open". If the trigger detects "open", it fires. If the condition checks "on", it should match.
          However, the prompt explicitly asks for `to: 'on'` in the trigger logic usually implied, or just a state change.
          I will set the trigger to `to: 'on'`.

          Let's write the code.
