    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

          1.  **Analyze the Request:**
              *   **Goal:** Create a Home Assistant blueprint automation.
              *   **Trigger:** Humidity sensor value changes above a specific `humidity_level`.
              *   **Action 1:** Turn on a fan entity.
              *   **Action 2:** Turn off the fan entity when humidity drops back below the `humidity_level`.
              *   **Constraints:**
                  *   Do not turn fan *on* if it's already on.
                  *   Do not turn fan *off* if it's already off.
                  *   Use `sensor` for humidity, `number` for threshold, `fan` for the device.

          2.  **Determine the Automation Logic:**
              *   I need two automations (or one automation with two triggers).
              *   **Automation A (Turn On):**
                  *   Trigger: State of `humidity_sensor` > `humidity_level`.
                  *   Condition: Fan is off.
                  *   Action: Turn on fan.
              *   **Automation B (Turn Off):**
                  *   Trigger: State of `humidity_sensor` < `humidity_level`.
                  *   Condition: Fan is on.
                  *   Action: Turn off fan.

          3.  **Drafting the Blueprint Structure:**

              ```yaml
              blueprint:
                name: Humidity Fan
                description: Turns fan on when humidity rises above threshold and off when it drops.
                domain: automation
                input:
                  humidity_sensor:
                    name: Humidity Sensor
                    selector:
                      entity:
                        domain: sensor
                        device_class: humidity
                  humidity_level:
                    name: Humidity Level
                    selector:
                      number:
                        mode: slider
                        min: 0
                        max: 100
                        step: 1
                  fan_entity:
                    name: Fan Entity
                    selector:
                      entity:
                        domain: fan

              variables:
                threshold: !input humidity_level
                sensor_id: !input humidity_sensor
                fan_id: !input fan_entity

              trigger:
                # Trigger 1: High Humidity
                - platform: numeric_state
                  entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
                  above: !input humidity_level
                # Trigger 2: Low Humidity
                - platform: numeric_state
                  entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
                  below: !input humidity_level

              condition:
                - condition: state
                  entity_id: !input fan_entity
                  state: off
                # Wait, if I trigger "below", I need to check if it's on.
                # But if I check "off" for the "below" trigger, it won't match (since it's below).
                # Let's re-evaluate.
                # Scenario 1: Humidity rises above. Fan is off. Action: Turn on.
                # Scenario 2: Humidity drops below. Fan is on. Action: Turn off.
                # So I need two separate automations to handle the specific conditions easily, OR one automation with two triggers and logic.

              # Approach: One Automation with Two Triggers
              trigger:
                - platform: numeric_state
                  entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
                  above: !input humidity_level
                - platform: numeric_state
                  entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
                  below: !input humidity_level

              action:
                - choose:
                    - conditions:
                        - condition: numeric_state
                          entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
                          above: !input humidity_level
                      sequence:
                        - service: fan.turn_on
                          entity_id: !input fan_entity
                    - conditions:
                        - condition: numeric_state
                          entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
                          below: !input humidity_level
                      sequence:
                        - service: fan.turn_off
                          entity_id: !input fan_entity
              ```

          4.  **Refining the Logic (Self-Correction):**
              *   The choose block logic above is clean.
              *   *Trigger 1 (Above):* Checks if state > threshold. If yes, turn on fan.
              *   *Trigger 2 (Below):* Checks if state < threshold. If yes, turn off fan.
              *   *Check constraints:* "The automation should not try to turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is already off."
                  *   `fan.turn_on` command in Home Assistant ignores the request if the fan is already on (it just sends the signal, which might be a repeat, but the HA docs say it handles it). However, for robustness, a `condition` is better, though usually `fan.turn_on` works fine if the fan is in a state where it doesn't re-cycle.
                  *   *Correction:* If the fan is already on, `fan.turn_on` is technically redundant. But usually, for these simple blueprints, relying on the service behavior or a specific condition is standard. The prompt implies logic checks.
                  *   Let's look at the prompt again: "The automation should not try to turn the fan on if it is already on".
                  *   This implies a `condition` is required to ensure the fan state is 'off' before turning it on.
                  *   Similarly for turning it off.
                  *   Let's use `choose` logic effectively.

          5.  **Finalizing the Code:**

              *Wait, I separated the triggers incorrectly for the "Turn On" case.*
              If I trigger on "Above", and check "Fan is off", it works.
              But if I trigger on "Below", checking "Fan is off" will fail (it's on), so it won't turn it off. That logic holds for the "Turn Off" branch?
              No, if I want to turn it *off*, the condition should be "Fan is on".
              If I stick to one automation with two triggers and a single `action` section, I need to differentiate.
              The `choose` block is the best way to handle "If Trigger A -> Action X" vs "If Trigger B -> Action Y".

              *Check:* Does `fan.turn_on` turn it off if it's on? No.
              Does `fan.turn_off` turn it on if it's off? No.
              Does the `condition` block ensure we don't do the redundant action? Yes. If the fan is already on, it won't turn it on again.

          6.  **Formatting:** Ensure it's a valid YAML block. Keep it plain text.

              *One minor optimization:*
              The prompt asks for a blueprint.
              I will structure it clearly.

              ```yaml
              blueprint:

                    - conditions:
                        - condition: numeric_state
                          entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
                          above: !input humidity_level

                            entity_id: !input fan_entity
                    - conditions:
                        - condition: numeric_state
                          entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
                          below: !input humidity_level
                      sequence:

                            entity_id: !input fan_entity
              ```
              Wait, I used `entity_id` in some places and `target` in others. Standard practice is consistent. I'll stick to `entity_id` inside `target:` or just `entity_id`. I'll use the standard format.

              Let's double check the "not try to turn on if already on" requirement.
              If I trigger "above", check if fan is off. If yes, turn on. If no (already on), skip. Correct.
              If I trigger "below", check if fan is on. If yes, turn off. If no (already off), skip. Correct.

              Is there any edge case? No, this covers the requirements.

              The output should just be the YAML code block.
