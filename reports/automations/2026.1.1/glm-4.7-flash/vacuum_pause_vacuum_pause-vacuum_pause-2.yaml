    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

          1.  **Analyze the Request:**
              *   **Goal:** Create a Home Assistant Blueprint automation.
              *   **Trigger:** A `binary_sensor` named `phone_call_sensor` turning ON.
              *   **Condition:** The `vacuum_entity` is currently running.
              *   **Action:** Pause the vacuum.
              *   **Constraints:** Keep it simple, use specific input variables.

          2.  **Identify the Blueprint Structure:**
              *   Blueprints in Home Assistant usually start with `blueprint:`.
              *   They need a `alias`, `description`, `domain`, and `input`.
              *   The `input` section needs `phone_call_sensor` (type: `binary_sensor`) and `vacuum_entity` (type: `vacuum`).
              *   The `trigger` section needs to match the input `phone_call_sensor`.
              *   The `condition` section needs to check if the vacuum state is `cleaning` (or `docked`, but usually we only want to pause if it's actually moving).
              *   The `action` section needs to call the service `vacuum.pause` on the `vacuum_entity`.

          3.  **Drafting the YAML:**

              *   *Header:*
                  ```yaml
                  blueprints:
                    id: "vacuum_pause_on_phone_call"
                    domain: automation
                    name: "Vacuum Pause on Phone Call"
                  ```

              *   *Input Definition:*
                  ```yaml
                  input:
                    phone_call_sensor:
                      name: Phone Call Sensor
                      description: A binary sensor triggering on incoming calls.
                      selector:
                        entity:
                          domain: binary_sensor
                    vacuum_entity:
                      name: Vacuum
                      description: The vacuum to pause.
                      selector:
                        entity:
                          domain: vacuum
                  ```

              *   *Trigger:*
                  ```yaml
                  trigger:
                    - platform: state
                      entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
                      to: "on"
                  ```

              *   *Condition:*
                  ```yaml
                  condition:
                    - platform: state
                      entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
                      state: "cleaning"
                  ```

              *   *Action:*
                  ```yaml
                  action:
                    - service: vacuum.pause
                      target:
                        entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
                  ```

          4.  **Refining the Blueprint:**
              *   The problem statement asks for a specific format ("Create a blueprint automation"). I should provide just the YAML code block.
              *   I will combine these into a clean, copy-pasteable YAML block.

          5.  **Final Code Construction:**
              ```yaml
              blueprints:
                id: "vacuum_pause_on_call"
                domain: automation
                name: "Vacuum Pause on Call"

                input:
                  phone_call_sensor:
                    name: Phone Call Sensor
                    description: A binary sensor that triggers when a phone call is received.
                    selector:
                      entity:
                        domain: binary_sensor

                  vacuum_entity:
                    name: Vacuum Entity
                    description: The vacuum entity to pause.
                    selector:
                      entity:
                        domain: vacuum

                trigger:
                  - platform: state
                    entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
                    to: "on"

                condition:
                  - platform: state
                    entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
                    state: "cleaning"

                action:
                  - service: vacuum.pause
                    target:
                      entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
              ```

          6.  **Review against constraints:**
              *   *Trigger:* `phone_call_sensor` fires -> Check.
              *   *Condition:* Vacuum is running (state: cleaning) -> Check.
              *   *Action:* Pause vacuum -> Check.
              *   *Inputs:* Correct types -> Check.
              *   *Format:* Plain text, YAML block -> Check.

          7.  **Output Generation:** (Presenting the result).
