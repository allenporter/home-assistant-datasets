    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here’s a simple automation blueprint for your use case:

  ### **Automation Blueprint**
  ```yaml
  alias: "Play Alert When Door Left Open"
  description: "Plays an alert when a door is left open for too long."
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: "{{ input_select.door_sensor }}"
      to: "open"
      for:
        minutes: "{{ input_duration.open_duration | int / 60 }}"
  mode: single

  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ input_media.alert_media }}"
      data:
        media_type: "music"
        media_title: "Door Open Alert"
        media_id: "your_alert_sound_file"  # Replace with actual media ID or file path
      data_template:
        volume_level: "{{ state_attr('media_player', 'volume_level') | default(0.7) }}"

  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: "{{ input_select.door_sensor }}"
      state: "open"
  ```

  ### **How to Use:**
  1. **Inputs:**
     - `door_sensor`: Replace with your door sensor entity ID (e.g., `binary_sensor.garage_door`).
     - `alert_media`: Replace with your speaker entity ID (e.g., `media_player.living_room_speaker`) and media ID (e.g., a sound file or URL).
     - `open_duration`: Set the time (e.g., `30` for 30 minutes).

  2. **How it works:**
     - Triggers when the door state changes to "open" for the specified duration.
     - Plays the alert on the selected speaker.

  ### **Notes:**
  - Ensure your door sensor supports `state` triggers.
  - Adjust `media_type` and `media_title` as needed.
  - For a sound file, use a URL or local file path (e.g., `media_id: "file:///path/to/sound.mp3"`).
