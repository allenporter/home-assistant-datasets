    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here’s a simple blueprint for pausing a vacuum when a phone call is received:

  ---
  **Name:** Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
  **Description:** Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is detected (binary sensor triggers).

  ### **Inputs:**
  - `phone_call_sensor`: A `binary_sensor` (e.g., `input_binary_sensor` or a real phone call sensor).
  - `vacuum_entity`: A `vacuum` device (e.g., `my_vacuum`).

  ### **Automation:**
  ```yaml
  mode: single
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: "{{ phone_call_sensor }}"
    to: "on"

  action:
    - service: vacuum.pause
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ vacuum_entity }}"
      data: {}
  ```

  ### **Notes:**
  - Ensure the vacuum supports pausing (not just stopping).
  - The vacuum will pause but remain in a ready state—resume manually via the vacuum’s UI or `vacuum.resume` service.
  - Works when the vacuum is already running.
