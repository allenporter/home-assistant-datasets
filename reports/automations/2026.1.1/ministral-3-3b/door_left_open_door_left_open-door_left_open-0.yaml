    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here’s a simple blueprint for your automation:

  ### **Automation Blueprint**
  ```yaml
  alias: "Play Alert When Door Left Open"
  description: "Play an alert when a door is left open for too long."
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: "{{ door_sensor }}"
      to: "open"
      for:
        seconds: "{{ open_duration }}"
  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ alert_media }}"
      data:
        media_type: "music"
        media_url: ""  # Replace with your alert sound file path if needed
        volume_level: 0.7  # Optional: Adjust volume
  mode: single
  ```

  ### **How to Use:**
  1. **Set up inputs** in your `configuration.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     input_select:
       door_sensor:
         options:
           - binary_sensor.garage_door
           - binary_sensor.front_door
         default: binary_sensor.garage_door
       alert_media:
         options:
           - media_player.living_room_speaker
           - media_player.kitchen_speaker
         default: media_player.living_room_speaker
       open_duration:
         options:
           - 30
           - 5
         default: 30
     ```

  2. **Trigger the automation** via the UI or CLI with:
     ```bash
     /config/automation/trigger --entity_id door_sensor --to open --duration 30
     ```

  ### **Notes:**
  - Replace `binary_sensor.garage_door` with your actual door sensor.
  - Replace `media_player.living_room_speaker` with your speaker entity.
  - For a custom alert sound, use a file path (e.g., `media://alert.mp3`).
