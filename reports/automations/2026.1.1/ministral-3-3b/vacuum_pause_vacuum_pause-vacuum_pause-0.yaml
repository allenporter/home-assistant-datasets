    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here’s a simple blueprint for pausing a vacuum when a phone call is received:

  ---
  **Name:** Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
  **Description:** Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is detected and it's running.

  **Inputs:**
  - `phone_call_sensor`: A binary sensor that triggers on incoming calls.
  - `vacuum_entity`: The vacuum device to pause.

  **States:**
  - **Trigger:** When `phone_call_sensor` turns on.
  - **Condition:** Vacuum must be in `running` state.
  - **Action:** Set vacuum to `paused` state.

  ---
  **Code:**
  ```yaml
  alias: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
  description: Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is detected.
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: "{{ phone_call_sensor }}"
      to: "on"
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: "{{ vacuum_entity }}"
      state: "running"
  action:
    - service: vacuum.pause
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ vacuum_entity }}"
  mode: single
  ```

  ---
  **Notes:**
  - Replace `{{ phone_call_sensor }}` and `{{ vacuum_entity }}` with your actual entity IDs.
  - Ensure your vacuum supports the `pause` service (check Home Assistant logs if it fails).
  - The vacuum will resume automatically when the call ends or manually resumed.
