    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  Here’s a simple blueprint for your Home Assistant automation:

  ```yaml
  alias: Humidity Fan Control
  description: Turns on a fan when humidity exceeds a threshold and turns it off when humidity drops below.
  mode: single
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: "{{ states(humidity_sensor) }}"
    to: "{{ humidity_level }}"
    attribute: "state"  # Use "state" to detect changes above/below threshold
  action:
    - if:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: "{{ fan_entity }}"
          state: "on"
      then:
        - service: fan.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: "{{ fan_entity }}"
    - if:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: "{{ fan_sensor }}"
          state: "{{ humidity_level }}"
      then:
        - service: fan.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: "{{ fan_entity }}"
  ```

  ### Notes:
  - This assumes the trigger detects **both rising and falling** humidity (adjust `to` if needed).
  - For **only rising** (e.g., bathroom fan), use:
    ```yaml
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: "{{ humidity_sensor }}"
      to: "{{ humidity_level }}"
      attribute: "state"  # Only triggers when state changes *above* threshold
    ```
  - For **only falling** (e.g., garage), use:
    ```yaml
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: "{{ humidity_sensor }}"
      from: "{{ humidity_level }}"
      attribute: "state"  # Only triggers when state changes *below* threshold
    ```
