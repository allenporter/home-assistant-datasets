    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here’s a simple blueprint for your automation:

  ---
  **Name:** Door Open Alert
  **Description:** Plays an alert when a door is left open for a specified duration.

  ### **Inputs:**
  - `door_sensor`: A binary_sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.garage_door`).
  - `alert_media`: A media player and media ID (e.g., `media_player.living_room`, `media_id.alert`).
  - `open_duration`: Duration (e.g., `00:30:00` for 30 minutes).

  ### **Automation Code:**
  ```yaml
  mode: single
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: "{{ door_sensor }}"
    to: "on"  # Door is open

  action:
    - delay: "{{ open_duration }}"
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ alert_media }}"
      data:
        media_id: "alert"  # Replace with your actual media ID
        volume_level: 0.5  # Optional: Adjust volume
  ```

  ### **How to Use:**
  1. **Configure the blueprint** in Home Assistant under *Automations > Blueprints*.
  2. **Set inputs** in the blueprint editor:
     - Select your `door_sensor`.
     - Choose your `media_player` and `media_id`.
     - Enter the `open_duration` (e.g., `00:05:00` for 5 minutes).
  3. **Test & enable** the automation.

  ---
  **Note:** Ensure your `media_id` matches the alert sound you want to play. Adjust `volume_level` if needed.
