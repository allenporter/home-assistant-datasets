    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here’s a simple blueprint for your automation:

  ---
  **Name:** `door_open_alert`
  **Description:** Plays an alert when a door is left open for a specified duration.

  ### **Inputs:**
  - `door_sensor`: A `binary_sensor` (e.g., `binary_sensor.garage_door`).
  - `alert_media`: A `media_player` and `media_id` (e.g., `media_player.living_room` + `media_id.alert_sound`).
  - `open_duration`: Duration (e.g., `00:30:00` for 30 minutes).

  ### **Automation:**
  ```yaml
  mode: single
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: "{{ door_sensor }}"
    to: "on"  # Door is open

  action:
    - delay: "{{ open_duration }}"
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ alert_media.entity_id }}"
      data:
        media_id: "{{ alert_media.media_id }}"
        volume_level: 0.7  # Optional: Adjust volume
  ```

  ### **How to Use:**
  1. **Configure inputs** in your `configuration.yaml` or via the UI:
     - `door_sensor`: Your door sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.front_door`).
     - `alert_media`: Your speaker + media ID (e.g., `media_player.kitchen_speaker` + `media_id.warning`).
     - `open_duration`: Set to your desired time (e.g., `00:05:00` for 5 minutes).

  2. **Test it** by opening the door and checking if the alert plays after the delay.

  ---
  **Note:** Ensure your door sensor is set to `off` when closed and `on` when open. Adjust `volume_level` as needed.
