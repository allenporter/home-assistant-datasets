    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here’s a simple blueprint for your automation:

  ### **Automation Blueprint**
  ```yaml
  alias: "Play Alert When Door Left Open"
  description: "Plays an alert when a door is left open for a specified duration."
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: "{{ door_sensor }}"
      to: "open"
      for:
        hours: 0
        minutes: "{{ open_duration.split(':')[0] }}"
        seconds: "{{ open_duration.split(':')[1] if open_duration.count(':') > 0 else '0' }}"
  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ alert_media }}"
      data:
        media_type: "music"
        media_url: ""  # Replace with your alert sound file path or use a service like `media_player.play_media` with a predefined alert
        volume_level: 0.7  # Adjust volume as needed
  mode: single
  ```

  ---

  ### **How to Use:**
  1. **Replace placeholders** with your actual entities:
     - `door_sensor`: Your binary sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.garage_door`).
     - `alert_media`: Your media player (e.g., `media_player.living_room_speaker`).
     - `open_duration`: The time threshold (e.g., `00:30` for 30 minutes).

  2. **Alternative for Alert Sound**:
     Use a predefined alert sound (e.g., a `.mp3` file) or a service like:
     ```yaml
     service: media_player.play_media
     target:
       entity_id: "{{ alert_media }}"
     data:
       media_type: "music"
       media_url: "file:///path/to/alert_sound.mp3"
     ```

  3. **Test & Debug**:
     - Use `logger.log` to check if the trigger fires:
       ```yaml
       action:
         - service: logger.log
           data:
             message: "Door open for {{ open_duration }}!"
       ```

  ---
  ### **Notes**:
  - Ensure the door sensor is in `open` state for the duration.
  - Adjust `volume_level` or use a different media player method if needed.
