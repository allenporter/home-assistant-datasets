    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Here’s a simple blueprint for your automation:

  ---
  **Name:** `light_on_when_door_opens`
  **Description:** Turns on a light when a door opens and turns it off after 2 minutes or when the door closes.

  **Inputs:**
  - `door_sensor`: A binary sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.pantry_door`).
  - `light_switch`: A light entity (e.g., `light.pantry_light`).

  ---
  **Code:**
  ```yaml
  alias: "Light on when door opens"
  description: "Turns on a light when a door opens and turns it off after 2 minutes or when the door closes."
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: "{{ inputs.door_sensor }}"
      to: "open"
  mode: single
  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ inputs.light_switch }}"
    - delay: "00:02:00"  # Wait 2 minutes
    - service: light.turn_off
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ inputs.light_switch }}"
    - service: binary_sensor.turn_off
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ inputs.door_sensor }}"
  ```

  ---
  **Notes:**
  - Replace `{{ inputs.door_sensor }}` and `{{ inputs.light_switch }}` with your actual entity IDs.
  - If the door closes before 2 minutes, the light will turn off automatically.
  - Works with any `binary_sensor` and `light` entity.
