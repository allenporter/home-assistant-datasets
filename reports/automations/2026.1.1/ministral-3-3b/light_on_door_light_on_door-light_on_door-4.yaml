    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Here’s a simple blueprint for your automation:

  ---
  **Name:** `light_on_when_door_opens`
  **Description:** Turns on a light when a door opens and turns it off after 2 minutes or when the door closes.

  **Inputs:**
  - `door_sensor`: A binary sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.pantry_door`).
  - `light_switch`: A light entity (e.g., `light.pantry_light`).

  **Code:**
  ```yaml
  trigger:
    platform: state
    entity_id: "{{ states[states.door_sensor.state] }}"
    to: "open"

  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ states.light_switch.state }}"
    - delay: "00:02:00"  # Wait 2 minutes
    - service: light.turn_off
      target:
        entity_id: "{{ states.light_switch.state }}"

    # Optional: Turn off if door closes before timeout
    - alias: "Check if door closed"
      condition:
        platform: state
        entity_id: "{{ states.door_sensor.state }}"
        state: "closed"
      then:
        - service: light.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: "{{ states.light_switch.state }}"
  ```

  ---
  ### Notes:
  - Replace `door_sensor` and `light_switch` with your actual entity IDs.
  - The automation will turn the light on when the door opens, then turn it off after 2 minutes or if the door closes.
  - Adjust the delay time as needed.
