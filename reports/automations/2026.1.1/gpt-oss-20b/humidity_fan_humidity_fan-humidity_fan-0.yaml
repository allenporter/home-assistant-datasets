    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

              state: 'on'

  action:
    - service: fan.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: !input fan_entity
      data: {}
      # The action will only be executed when the above condition matches,
      # i.e., when humidity is above threshold and fan is off.

      data: {}
      # The action will only be executed when the below condition matches,
      # i.e., when humidity is below threshold and fan is on.
  ```

  **How it works**

  1. Two triggers fire when the humidity sensor crosses the chosen threshold.
  2. The condition block checks whether the fan is in the appropriate state
     (off when turning on, on when turning off).
  3. Only the matching action (turn on or turn off) is executed, preventing
     redundant service calls.

  You can copy this YAML into a new blueprint file (e.g., `humidity_fan.yaml`) and import it into Home Assistant. The automation will then appear in your automations list with the three input fields ready to configure.

             (off when turning on, on when turning off).

        thinking_content: |-
          We need to produce a blueprint YAML for HA. Input: humidity_sensor, humidity_level, fan_entity. Trigger: humidity_sensor state > humidity_level. Condition: when above, turn fan on? Wait description: "The automation should trigger when the humidity_sensor level goes above humidity_level. When triggered, the fan should be turned off." Wait that seems contradictory: Usually high humidity -> turn fan on. But they wrote turned off. Perhaps mis-scribed. They also say "fan should also be stopped when the sensor goes back down below the desired level." So fan should be turned off when humidity goes below? That means fan runs when humidity above threshold, stops when below. So initial line incorrectly says "turn off" maybe means turn on. We need to interpret: When humidity goes above threshold, turn fan on. When below threshold, turn fan off.

          Also "automation should not try to turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is already off." So actions with service fan.turn_on or fan.turn_off. But we need to guard by conditions checking current state. In HA, we can use condition: fan is off before turn_on. And fan is on before turn_off. Use condition: state entity fan_entity is 'off' before turning on, and 'on' before turning off. But we need separate triggers for above and below. We can use two triggers: one for > threshold, one for < threshold. Or one trigger with state changed and conditions using numeric state. But easier: two triggers with state change to value > threshold and < threshold.

          Blueprint format: "blueprint" at top. Provide input definitions. Provide automation with triggers, conditions, actions.

          Need to use numeric_state trigger: entity: humidity_sensor, above: humidity_level. Condition: fan is off. Action: fan.turn_on fan_entity.

          Second trigger: entity: humidity_sensor, below: humidity_level. Condition: fan is on. Action: fan.turn_off fan_entity.

          Also we need to ensure triggers only when state changes: numeric_state automatically triggers on change. Good.

          We might also want to set fan entity's current fan_speed? Probably not. Just on/off.

          Add description in blueprint.

          Time to craft YAML.

          Also need to consider "entity_id" for fan entity. So action: service: fan.turn_on. entity_id: !input fan_entity.

          Similarly fan.turn_off.

          Ok produce final answer.
