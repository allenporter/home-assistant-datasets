    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

          We need to produce blueprint YAML for Home Assistant automation. The user asks: "Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call." They want two inputs: phone_call_sensor and vacuum_entity. It triggers when phone_call_sensor becomes true (i.e., call start). It also should check if vacuum is running. Then pause the vacuum. Provide blueprint with triggers, conditions, actions. Should be simple.

          We need to output in plain text, no code fences? They didn't mention not to use code fences, but we can output YAML. The instructions: "Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point." Probably we can provide YAML code block. But plain text may be ambiguous. We'll output YAML code block. That's okay.

          Let's design blueprint:

          blueprint:
            name: Pause vacuum on phone call
            domain: automation
            input:
              phone_call_sensor:
                name: Phone call sensor
                description: Binary sensor that becomes 'on' when a phone call is received.
                selector:
                  entity:
                    domain: binary_sensor
              vacuum_entity:
                name: Vacuum
                description: Vacuum entity to pause.
                selector:
                  entity:
                    domain: vacuum
            trigger:
              - platform: state
                entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
                to: 'on'
            condition:
              - condition: state
                entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
                state: 'cleaning'
            action:
              - service: vacuum.pause
                target:
                  entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
            mode: single

          Add maybe for clarity.

          Thus produce.
