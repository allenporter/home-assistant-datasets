    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

          We need to create a blueprint for Home Assistant automation. Provide YAML code. Need to accept two inputs: phone_call_sensor (binary_sensor), vacuum_entity. Trigger when phone_call_sensor becomes true and vacuum is running. Condition that vacuum state is "cleaning" or "paused"? Should be running: maybe "cleaning" or "paused"? but we want to pause if running. So condition: vacuum.state is "cleaning" or maybe "auto" but better to check if state is "cleaning" or "returning"? Usually vacuum state "cleaning" indicates active. We'll just check state not "idle". Condition: vacuum is not idle.

          Action: service vacuum.pause. Then we might set a context? No. That's it.

          Also optionally we could set a variable to resume later, but not required.

          Let's craft blueprint. Provide description.

          We should include template for trigger: platform: state, entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor, to: 'on'? But binary_sensor state changes to "on". We'll trigger when to: 'on'.

          Condition: vacuum_entity is not idle: template: "{{ is_state('!input vacuum_entity', 'cleaning') or is_state('!input vacuum_entity', 'returning') or is_state('!input vacuum_entity', 'docked')? }" Actually docked may be considered idle. So maybe check that vacuum.state is not in ['idle', 'docked', 'paused', 'error', 'stopped', 'charging']. Actually we want to pause if cleaning. So we can check is_state('!input vacuum_entity', 'cleaning').

          Better to check is_state('!input vacuum_entity', 'cleaning').

          Action: service: vacuum.pause, entity_id: !input vacuum_entity.

          Also maybe log.

          Add blueprint metadata.

          Let's craft YAML.

          Use name, domain: automation, input etc.

          Return the final blueprint.
