    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  **Blueprint – Pause Vacuum When Phone Call Starts**

  ```yaml
  blueprint:

      The automation triggers when the binary sensor turns on
      and the vacuum is currently cleaning. The vacuum is paused
      (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

          We need to produce a blueprint automation for Home Assistant. The instructions say: "Answer questions about the world truthfully. Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point. Current time is 06:27:53. Today's date is 2026-01-18."

          User wants blueprint code. We should output the blueprint YAML. They want two inputs: phone_call_sensor and vacuum_entity. Trigger on phone_call_sensor turned on (maybe from false to true). Condition: vacuum is running. Then action: call vacuum_entity.pause.

          We need blueprint header. Provide blueprint id, name, domain etc. Provide description.

          We should include the inputs in blueprint. For phone_call_sensor we set type: "binary_sensor". For vacuum_entity type: "vacuum". Provide trigger: platform: state, entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor, to: "on" (or 'true').

          Condition: vacuum_entity.state == 'cleaning' (or maybe 'vacuuming' depending on platform). Use condition: state. entity_id: !input vacuum_entity, state: "cleaning". Alternatively use 'vacuuming' or 'start'. But typical state is 'cleaning' when robot is cleaning. Let's use 'cleaning'.

          Action: service: vacuum.pause. data: entity_id: !input vacuum_entity.

          Also could add optional to set 'paused' property but not needed.

          Add comment. Add example usage. But blueprint is enough.

          Edge: The sensor might not be binary_sensor; could be device tracker? But they said binary_sensor. Fine.

          Return YAML with correct indentation. Provide description at top.

          Also set version: 1. Use 'source_url' maybe omitted. Provide default. Provide fields.

          Let's craft.

          ```yaml
          blueprint:
            name: Pause vacuum on phone call
            description: |
              Pauses a vacuum robot when a phone call is detected.
              The automation will trigger when the binary sensor turns on
              and the vacuum is currently cleaning. The vacuum will be paused
              (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.
            domain: automation
            input:
              phone_call_sensor:
                name: Phone call sensor
                description: Binary sensor that indicates a phone call is active.
                selector:
                  entity:
                    domain: binary_sensor
              vacuum_entity:
                name: Vacuum entity
                description: Vacuum robot entity to pause.
                selector:
                  entity:
                    domain: vacuum
            example:
              trigger:
                - platform: state
                  entity_id: binary_sensor.my_phone_call
                  to: 'on'
              condition:
                - condition: state
                  entity_id: vacuum.my_robot
                  state: 'cleaning'
              action:
                - service: vacuum.pause
                  target:
                    entity_id: vacuum.my_robot
          ```

          Wait blueprint requires inputs defined. The example section is optional. The proper format: after input, provide `automation:`? Actually blueprint format: after `blueprint:` header, there is `trigger:`, `condition:`, `action:` at the root level of blueprint, using !input placeholders. The `example:` optional can include an example. Use correct indentation. So structure:

          ```
          blueprint:
            name: ...
            description: ...
            domain: automation
            input:
              phone_call_sensor:
                name: ...
                selector: ...
              vacuum_entity:
                name: ...
                selector: ...
          trigger:
            - platform: state
              entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
              to: 'on'
          condition:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
              state: 'cleaning'
          action:
            - service: vacuum.pause
              target:
                entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
          ```

          Better to use `service: vacuum.pause` with `data: entity_id`. But Home Assistant v2025+ uses target.

          We can also include condition: not paused? But ok.

          We also might add "id" field. Provide "source_url". Not needed.

          Let's produce final answer.
