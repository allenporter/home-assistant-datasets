    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

          We need to produce a blueprint automation. The user wants blueprint for Home Assistant that pauses vacuum when phone call binary sensor becomes true, and vacuum is running. The blueprint inputs: phone_call_sensor and vacuum_entity. Output: pause vacuum.

          We need to output YAML for a Home Assistant blueprint. We should keep simple. Use trigger: platform: state, from: 'off', to: 'on', entity_id: input. Condition: vacuum_entity state 'cleaning', maybe 'vacuum.state == "cleaning"'. action: service: vacuum.pause. For vacuum, service: vacuum.pause (domain vacuum). So we need to pass entity. The blueprint will have name, description, domain, input.

          We need to output just the blueprint. Plain text, no code fences? The instruction says "Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point." But YAML typically uses code fences; but maybe we just give YAML plain. Should not wrap in triple backticks. We'll provide YAML indentation. Use "blueprint:" top.

          Let's craft:

          blueprint:
            name: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
            description: Pause the vacuum when a phone call is received.
            domain: automation
            input:
              phone_call_sensor:
                name: Phone Call Sensor
                selector:
                  entity:
                    domain: binary_sensor
              vacuum_entity:
                name: Vacuum
                selector:
                  entity:
                    domain: vacuum
            trigger:
              - platform: state
                entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
                to: 'on'
            condition:
              - condition: state
                entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
                state: 'cleaning'
            action:
              - service: vacuum.pause
                target:
                  entity_id: !input vacuum_entity

          We may need to add description and id. Also we might add trigger: state from 'off' to 'on'. But state to 'on' is fine. Provide a 'from' maybe. Provide "from: 'off'". Let's do that.

          Also maybe we should add 'enabled: true' etc? Not necessary.

          Let's produce final answer.
