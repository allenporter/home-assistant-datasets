    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

          We need to create a blueprint automation for Home Assistant. The assistant should produce the blueprint YAML code. It must have inputs: phone_call_sensor (binary_sensor) and vacuum_entity. It triggers when phone_call_sensor becomes on (or true). Additionally, only if vacuum is running. Should pause vacuum. Probably check vacuum.is_cleaning or vacuum.is_running. The vacuum domain. Use action to service vacuum.pause. So blueprint content.

          Also include example use cases? Not needed. Provide only blueprint.

          Return plain text. Should include id, name, description, input definitions, trigger, condition, action. Use variables for entity. Condition: vacuum_entity is running. For vacuums, typical attributes: is_cleaning, is_returning? Or use state == 'cleaning' or 'returning'? Use state attribute: state == 'cleaning' or state == 'returning'? We just use 'cleaning' maybe. Could also check vacuum_entity == 'cleaning' state. But some vacuums might be 'returning', still running. But requirement is pause when running. So condition: state = 'cleaning' or 'returning'. We'll use state != 'idle' maybe. But we can be precise: state in ['cleaning', 'returning']. Provide condition. Use variables: phone_call_sensor, vacuum_entity.

          Blueprint YAML:

          blueprint:
            name: Pause vacuum when phone call
            description: Pause vacuum when a binary sensor indicates a phone call.
            domain: automation
            input:
              phone_call_sensor:
                name: Phone Call Sensor
                selector:
                  entity:
                    domain: binary_sensor
              vacuum_entity:
                name: Vacuum
                selector:
                  entity:
                    domain: vacuum
          trigger:
            - platform: state
              entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
              to: 'on'
          condition:
            - condition: or
              conditions:
                - condition: state
                  entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
                  state: cleaning
                - condition: state
                  entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
                  state: returning
          action:
            - service: vacuum.pause
              target:
                entity_id: !input vacuum_entity

          Also maybe add variable to pause only if running. Done.

          Return blueprint YAML.
