    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  ```

  **How to use**

  1. Add the blueprint to Home Assistant.
  2. Create a new automation from the blueprint.
  3. Pick your humidity sensor, desired threshold, and fan entity.

  The automation will automatically turn the fan on when humidity rises above the chosen level and turn it off when it drops below that level, without toggling the fan if it's already in the desired state.

          **How to use**

          1. Add the blueprint to Home Assistant.
          2. Create a new automation from the blueprint.
          3. Pick your humidity sensor, desired threshold, and fan entity.

          The automation will automatically turn the fan on when humidity rises above the chosen level and turn it off when it drops below that level, without toggling the fan if it's already in the desired state.
        thinking_content: "We need to produce a blueprint YAML for Home Assistant.\
          \ The user wants a blueprint that turns fan on when humidity above threshold,\
          \ and off when below threshold. Actually the description says: \"The automation\
          \ should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`.\
          \ When triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped\
          \ when the sensor goes back down below the desired level.\" Wait \"turned\
          \ off\" likely a mistake: should turn fan on when above threshold, and off\
          \ when below. Also mention \"should not try to turn fan on if it is already\
          \ on, and not turn off when already off.\" So we need a template that uses\
          \ 'condition' to check state before turning on/off.\n\nWe need blueprint\
          \ with triggers: state of humidity sensor > threshold. For each side: two\
          \ separate triggers: one when humidity > threshold, one when humidity <\
          \ threshold. Use for each. Then action: turn fan on/off accordingly. Use\
          \ condition: state not already that state. For fan entity.\n\nAlso blueprint\
          \ inputs: humidity_sensor, humidity_level, fan_entity.\n\nAdd description.\n\
          \nReturn plain text? The instruction says \"Answer in plain text.\" We can\
          \ output YAML code in plain text. Provide the blueprint. We'll include name,\
          \ description, domain: automation, input definitions, trigger, condition,\
          \ action. Use trigger: platform: numeric_state. For above: above: humidity_level.\
          \ For below: below: humidity_level.\n\nAlso use for_each? Not needed.\n\n\
          We need to define both triggers in a single automation with for each? Could\
          \ define triggers: numeric_state on humidity_sensor above humidity_level.\
          \ Then in action, check if fan_state is off and then turn on. But we need\
          \ separate for turning off. So we can have two triggers with a for each:\
          \ Actually Home Assistant allows multiple triggers, but then we need to\
          \ know which fired. We can add trigger_id? But easier: two separate automations?\
          \ But blueprint can have one automation with both triggers and use condition\
          \ on fan state. But we need to know if humidity above or below. We can check\
          \ the trigger state.\n\nApproach: In trigger: two triggers: numeric_state\
          \ above humidity_level; numeric_state below humidity_level. Then in action:\
          \ first check trigger id or use if condition: trigger to see which triggered?\
          \ Use `trigger` variable to determine new state: `trigger.entity_id` and\
          \ `trigger.state`. But easier: use two separate trigger and condition: use\
          \ trigger for numeric_state. Then use condition: if humidity_sensor above\
          \ threshold then fan on else off. But we need to know the direction. We\
          \ can use a template condition: `{{ trigger.to_state.state | float > humidity_level\
          \ }}`? But we can also use the state of humidity sensor.\n\nSimplest: Use\
          \ two separate triggers with condition: when above threshold, condition:\
          \ fan off. Action: turn fan on. For below threshold: condition: fan on.\
          \ Action: turn fan off. That ensures not double triggers.\n\nThus blueprint:\n\
          \n```\nblueprint:\n  name: Humidity Fan\n  domain: automation\n  input:\n\
          \    humidity_sensor:\n      name: Humidity sensor\n      description: Humidity\

          \        entity:\n          domain: fan\n```\n\nBut blueprint input syntax:\
          \ `input:` then each input defined with description, selector etc.\n\nActually\
          \ blueprint format: \n\n```\nblueprint:\n  name: Humidity Fan\n  domain:\

          \    entity:\n          domain: fan\n```\n\nNow define automation with triggers.\n\
          \n```\ntrigger:\n  - platform: numeric_state\n    entity_id: !input humidity_sensor\n\
          \    above: !input humidity_level\n  - platform: numeric_state\n    entity_id:\
          \ !input humidity_sensor\n    below: !input humidity_level\n```\n\nThen\
          \ use `for_each`? Not needed.\n\nThen conditions: use a condition that checks\
          \ fan state. But we need separate actions based on which trigger fired.\
          \ We can use template to check state. Use `action` with `choose`. For each\
          \ trigger, we check.\n\n```\naction:\n  - choose:\n      - conditions:\n\
          \          - condition: numeric_state\n            entity_id: !input humidity_sensor\n\
          \            above: !input humidity_level\n          - condition: state\n\
          \            entity_id: !input fan_entity\n            state: \"off\"\n\
          \        sequence:\n          - service: fan.turn_on\n            target:\n\
          \              entity_id: !input fan_entity\n      - conditions:\n     \
          \     - condition: numeric_state\n            entity_id: !input humidity_sensor\n\
          \            below: !input humidity_level\n          - condition: state\n\
          \            entity_id: !input fan_entity\n            state: \"on\"\n \
          \       sequence:\n          - service: fan.turn_off\n            target:\n\
          \              entity_id: !input fan_entity\n  - default: []\n```\n\nBut\
          \ we need to reference the sensor state? We use numeric_state condition\
          \ again to check sensor state. That ensures correct direction. Might be\
          \ fine.\n\nAlternatively, we can use trigger variables: `trigger.to_state.state`\
          \ but better to use numeric_state conditions.\n\nThus the blueprint code\
          \ is ready.\n\nAdd a description top-level: `blueprint: name: ... description:\
          \ ...`. Provide final blueprint YAML. Ensure plain text."
