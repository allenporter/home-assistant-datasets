    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.
response: |-
  The Entry Door is currently closed (state: 'off'). It is a binary_sensor with device_class: door, which makes it suitable for this automation.

  Here's how to set up the automation:

  1. **Door Sensor**: Use "Entry Door" (binary_sensor.entry_door) as the trigger
  2. **Alert Media**: Choose a media file or message to play (e.g., "Door left open" audio)
  3. **Open Duration**: Set to your desired time (e.g., 5 minutes)

  The automation will:
  - Monitor the Entry Door sensor
  - When it detects the door has been open for the specified duration, play the selected media on the speaker
  - You can choose any speaker (e.g., Living Room Speaker, Bedroom Speaker, etc.)

  Would you like me to help you create this automation with specific settings?

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.

          I can help you create an automation for this. Let me set it up using the appropriate tools.

          First, I'll need to identify the door sensor you want to monitor. From your device list, I see "Entry Door" is a binary_sensor, which could be the front door. Let me check its current state to confirm it's a door sensor.

          The Entry Door is currently closed (state: 'off'). It is a binary_sensor with device_class: door, which makes it suitable for this automation.

          Here's how to set up the automation:

          1. **Door Sensor**: Use "Entry Door" (binary_sensor.entry_door) as the trigger
          2. **Alert Media**: Choose a media file or message to play (e.g., "Door left open" audio)
          3. **Open Duration**: Set to your desired time (e.g., 5 minutes)

          The automation will:
          - Monitor the Entry Door sensor
          - When it detects the door has been open for the specified duration, play the selected media on the speaker
          - You can choose any speaker (e.g., Living Room Speaker, Bedroom Speaker, etc.)

          Would you like me to help you create this automation with specific settings?
