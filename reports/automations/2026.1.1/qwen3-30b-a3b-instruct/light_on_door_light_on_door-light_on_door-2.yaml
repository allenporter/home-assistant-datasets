    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  I can help you create an automation for this. Here's how to set it up in Home Assistant:

  1. Go to **Automations** in Home Assistant.
  2. Create a new automation with the following structure:

  ```yaml
  alias: "Turn on light when door opens"
  description: "Turns on a light when a door opens and turns it off after 2 minutes or when door closes"

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.pantry_door
      to: "on"
      from: "off"

  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: light.pantry_light
    - delay: "00:02:00"
    - service: light.turn_off
      target:
        entity_id: light.pantry_light

  # Optional: Add a second trigger to turn off the light if the door closes
  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.pantry_door
      state: "off"
  ```

  3. Replace `binary_sensor.pantry_door` with your actual door sensor entity.
  4. Replace `light.pantry_light` with your actual light entity.

  This automation will:
  - Turn on the light when the door opens (sensor changes to "on")
  - Turn off the light after 2 minutes
  - Also turn off the light if the door closes before the timer ends

  You can customize the delay time or add more lights by including multiple `light.turn_on` actions.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
