    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.
response: |-
  To create a blueprint automation in Home Assistant that turns on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor, follow these steps:

  1. Open Home Assistant and go to the **Automations** section.
  2. Click on **Create Automation**.
  3. Give your automation a name (e.g., "Humidity Fan Automation").
  4. Set the **Trigger**:
     - Select **Sensor** as the trigger type.
     - Choose the **humidity_sensor** entity from the list.
     - Set the **Condition** to **"Sensor value is greater than"** and enter the **humidity_level** (e.g., 60).
  5. Set the **Action**:
     - Select **Turn on** and choose the **fan_entity** (e.g., "Bathroom Exhaust Fan").
  6. Set a **Second Trigger**:
     - Select **Sensor** as the trigger type.
     - Choose the **humidity_sensor** entity from the list.
     - Set the **Condition** to **"Sensor value is less than"** and enter the **humidity_level** (e.g., 60).
  7. Set the **Second Action**:
     - Select **Turn off** and choose the **fan_entity** (e.g., "Bathroom Exhaust Fan").
  8. Save the automation.

  This automation ensures that the fan is turned on when the humidity level exceeds the set threshold and turned off when the humidity level drops below the threshold. It also ensures that the fan is not turned on if it is already on and not turned off if it is already off.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
