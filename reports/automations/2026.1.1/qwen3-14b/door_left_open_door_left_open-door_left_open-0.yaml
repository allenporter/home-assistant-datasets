    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  It seems like you're trying to work with automation blueprints, but I can't directly create or manage blueprints in Home Assistant. However, I can guide you on how to create this automation manually in Home Assistant.

  ### Steps to Create the Automation:

  1. **Open Home Assistant** and go to the **Automations** section.
  2. **Add a new automation** and set the **trigger** as follows:
     - **Trigger type**: State
     - **Entity**: The `binary_sensor` entity for the door (e.g., `binary_sensor.entry_door`).
     - **To**: `on` (the door being open).
  3. **Add a condition** (optional, if you want to wait for a specific duration before triggering the alert):
     - **Condition type**: Wait for duration
     - **Duration**: Set this to the `open_duration` (e.g., 30 minutes).
  4. **Add an action**:
     - **Action type**: Play media
     - **Media player**: Select the target media player (e.g., `media_player.smart_speaker` in the living room).
     - **Media**: Select the media (e.g., a sound file or message) you want to play as the alert.

  Let me know if you'd like help with any specific step or if you want to set this up for a different door or media player.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
