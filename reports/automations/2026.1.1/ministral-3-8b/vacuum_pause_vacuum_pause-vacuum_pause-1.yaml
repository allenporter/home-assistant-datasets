    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** for pausing a vacuum when a phone call is detected:

  ---
  **Name:** Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
  **Description:** Pauses a vacuum when a phone call is received.
  **Domain:** automation
  **Source:** [Your Name]

  ### **Inputs:**
  | **Name**            | **Type**          | **Description**                          |
  |---------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
  | `phone_call_sensor` | `binary_sensor`   | Binary sensor that triggers on call.     |
  | `vacuum_entity`     | `vacuum`          | Vacuum to pause when call starts.        |

  ### **Trigger:**
  - **Platform:** `state`
  - **Entity:** `phone_call_sensor`
  - **To:** `on`

  ### **Condition:**
  - **Condition:** `state`
  - **Entity:** `vacuum_entity`
  - **State:** `cleaning` or `returning` or `paused_by_app` or `paused` (adjust if needed)

  ### **Action:**
  - **Service:** `vacuum.pause`
  - **Target:** `vacuum_entity`

  ---
  **Notes:**
  - The vacuum will **pause** (not stop) when the call starts.
  - To resume, manually unpause the vacuum or use another automation.
  - Adjust the `state` condition if your vacuum uses different statuses.
