    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** for pausing a vacuum when a phone call is detected:

  ---
  **Name:** Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
  **Description:** Pauses a vacuum when a phone call is received.
  **Domain:** automation
  **Source:** custom

  ### **Inputs:**
  | **Input**            | **Type**       | **Description**                          |
  |----------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
  | `phone_call_sensor`  | `binary_sensor`| Binary sensor that triggers on call start. |
  | `vacuum_entity`      | `vacuum`       | Vacuum to pause when the call starts.    |

  ### **Trigger:**
  - **Platform:** `state`
  - **Entity:** `phone_call_sensor`
  - **To:** `on`

  ### **Condition:**
  - **Condition:** `state`
  - **Entity:** `vacuum_entity`
  - **State:** `cleaning` or `returning`

  ### **Action:**
  - **Service:** `vacuum.pause`
  - **Target:** `vacuum_entity`

  ---
  ### **How to Use:**
  1. **Add the Blueprint** in Home Assistant via the **Automation** tab.
  2. **Configure the inputs**:
     - Set `phone_call_sensor` to your phone call detection (e.g., a `binary_sensor` from an app like **Call Logs** or **Google Assistant**).
     - Set `vacuum_entity` to your vacuum (e.g., `vacuum.living_room`).
  3. **Save & Test**—the vacuum will pause when a call starts.

  ---
  **Notes:**
  - The vacuum will **pause** (not stop) and can be resumed manually.
  - If the call ends while the vacuum is paused, it will **not auto-resume** (you must manually restart it).
