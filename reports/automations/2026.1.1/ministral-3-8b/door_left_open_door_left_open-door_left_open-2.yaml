    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** for your door-open alert automation:

  ---
  **Name:** Door Left Open Alert
  **Description:** Plays an alert on a speaker when a door is left open for a specified duration.

  **Inputs:**
  | **Input**         | **Type**      | **Description**                                                                 |
  |-------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `door_sensor`     | `entity`      | Binary sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.garage_door`) that detects the door state. |
  | `alert_media`     | `media`       | Media player (e.g., `media_player.living_room`) and media ID (e.g., `alert.mp3`). |
  | `open_duration`   | `duration`    | Time (e.g., `00:30:00`) before triggering the alert.                          |

  ---
  ### **Automation Code:**
  ```yaml
  alias: "Door Left Open Alert"
  description: "Triggers an alert when a door is left open for a specified duration."
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
  action:
    - delay: !input open_duration
    - if:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: !input door_sensor
          state: "on"
      then:
        - service: media_player.play_media
          target:
            entity_id: !input alert_media
          data:
            media_content_id: !input alert_media
            media_content_type: "uri"
  ```

  ---
  ### **How It Works:**
  1. **Trigger:** Detects when the door sensor turns `on`.
  2. **Delay:** Waits for the specified duration (`open_duration`).
  3. **Check:** Verifies the door is still open before playing the alert.
  4. **Alert:** Plays the selected media on the target speaker.

  ---
  ### **Example Setup:**
  - **Door Sensor:** `binary_sensor.garage_door`
  - **Media Player:** `media_player.living_room`
  - **Media ID:** `alert.mp3` (or a sound notification like `notify.alert`)
  - **Duration:** `00:30:00` (30 minutes)

  ---
  ### **Notes:**
  - Ensure the `alert_media` input includes **both** the player and media ID (e.g., `media_player.living_room:alert.mp3`).
  - For notifications, replace `media_player.play_media` with `notify.notify` (if using a notification service).
