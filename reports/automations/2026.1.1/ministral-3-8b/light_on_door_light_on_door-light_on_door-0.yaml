    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** for turning on a light when a door opens, with a 2-minute timeout or manual off when the door closes:

  ---
  **Name:** Door Opens → Light On (2-Minute Timeout)
  **Description:** Turns on a light when a door opens, then turns it off after 2 minutes or when the door closes.

  **Inputs:**
  | **Input**         | **Type**       | **Description**                                      | **Required** |
  |-------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
  | `door_sensor`     | `binary_sensor`| The door sensor that triggers the automation.        | Yes          |
  | `light_switch`    | `light`        | The light(s) to turn on when the door opens.        | Yes          |

  ---
  ### **Automation Code (YAML)**
  ```yaml
  alias: "Door Opens → Light On (2-Minute Timeout)"
  description: "Turns on a light when a door opens, then turns it off after 2 minutes or when the door closes."
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
  action:
    - choose:
        # Turn on the light if it's off
      - conditions:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: !input light_switch
            state: "off"
        sequence:
          - service: light.turn_on
            target: !input light_switch
          # Set a 2-minute delay to turn off the light
          - delay: "00:02:00"
          - service: light.turn_off
            target: !input light_switch
      # If the door closes before 2 minutes, turn off the light immediately
      - conditions:
          - condition: state
            entity_id: !input door_sensor
            to: "off"
        sequence:
          - service: light.turn_off
            target: !input light_switch
  ```

  ---
  ### **How It Works:**
  1. **Trigger:** When the `door_sensor` turns `on` (door opens).
  2. **Action:**
     - If the light is off, turn it on.
     - Wait **2 minutes**, then turn it off.
     - **If the door closes before 2 minutes**, the light turns off immediately.

  ---
  ### **Notes:**
  - Replace `!input door_sensor` and `!input light_switch` with your actual entities.
  - Works with **single or multiple lights** (e.g., `light_switch: [light.pantry, light.hallway]`).
