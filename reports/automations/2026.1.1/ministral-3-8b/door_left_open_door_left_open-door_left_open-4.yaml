    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** for your door-open alert automation:

  ---
  **Name:** Door Left Open Alert
  **Description:** Plays an alert on a speaker when a door is left open for a specified duration.

  ### **Inputs:**
  | Input           | Type          | Required | Description                                  |
  |-----------------|---------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
  | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | Yes      | Binary sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.garage_door`) |
  | `alert_media`   | `media`       | Yes      | Media player (e.g., `media_player.living_room`) |
  | `open_duration` | `duration`    | Yes      | Time (e.g., `00:30:00` for 30 minutes)       |

  ### **Blueprint Code:**
  ```yaml
  alias: "Door Left Open Alert"
  description: "Plays an alert when a door is left open for a specified duration."
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
      for:
        hours: !input open_duration.hours
        minutes: !input open_duration.minutes
        seconds: !input open_duration.seconds
  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: !input alert_media
      data:
        media_content_id: !input alert_media.media_content_id
        media_content_type: !input alert_media.media_content_type
  mode: single
  ```

  ### **How to Use:**
  1. **Add the Blueprint** via the Home Assistant UI (Automations > Blueprints > Add from URL).
  2. **Configure Inputs:**
     - `door_sensor`: Select your door sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.garage_door`).
     - `alert_media`: Choose a speaker (e.g., `media_player.living_room`).
     - `open_duration`: Set the delay (e.g., `00:30:00` for 30 minutes).
  3. **Save & Test.**

  ### **Notes:**
  - The alert plays **only once** per trigger (mode: `single`).
  - Adjust `media_content_id` (e.g., a sound file URL or a notification) as needed.
