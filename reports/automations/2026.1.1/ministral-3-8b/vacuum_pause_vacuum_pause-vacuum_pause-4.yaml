    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** for pausing a vacuum when a phone call is detected:

  ---
  **Name:** Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
  **Description:** Pauses a vacuum when a phone call is received.
  **Domain:** automation
  **Source:** [Your Name]

  ### Inputs:
  | **Input**            | **Type**       | **Description**                          |
  |----------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
  | `phone_call_sensor`  | `binary_sensor`| Binary sensor that triggers on call.     |
  | `vacuum_entity`      | `vacuum`       | Vacuum to pause when the call starts.    |

  ### Triggers:
  - **Event:** `binary_sensor.state` changed to `on`
    **Platform:** `binary_sensor`
    **Entity ID:** `{{ phone_call_sensor }}`

  ### Conditions:
  - **Condition:** `state` of `{{ vacuum_entity }}` is `cleaning` or `returning`

  ### Actions:
  1. **Service:** `vacuum.pause`
     **Target:** `{{ vacuum_entity }}`
     **Data:** `{}` (no extra options needed)

  ---
  ### Notes:
  - The vacuum will **pause** (not stop) and can be resumed manually.
  - Works with any binary sensor (e.g., `call_log` or custom sensor).
  - Requires **Home Assistant 2023.10+** for blueprint support.

  ---
  **How to install:**
  1. Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes > Blueprints**.
  2. Click **+ Add Blueprint** > **Create from scratch**.
  3. Paste the YAML above (adjust entity IDs as needed).
  4. Save and configure inputs.
