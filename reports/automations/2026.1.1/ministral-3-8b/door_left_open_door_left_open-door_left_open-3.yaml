    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** for your door-open alert automation:

  ---
  **Name:** Door Left Open Alert
  **Description:** Plays an alert on a speaker when a door is left open for a specified duration.

  **Inputs:**
  | Input           | Selector Type | Required | Default | Description                                  |
  |-----------------|---------------|----------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
  | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | Yes      |         | Binary sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.garage_door`) |
  | `alert_media`   | `media`       | Yes      |         | Media player + media ID (e.g., `media_player.living_room: "door_alert.mp3"`) |
  | `open_duration` | `duration`    | Yes      | `00:30:00` | Time before triggering (e.g., `00:05:00` for 5 mins) |

  ---
  **YAML Code:**
  ```yaml
  alias: "Door Left Open Alert"
  description: "Triggers an alert when a door is left open for a specified duration."
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
  action:
    - delay: !input open_duration
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: !input alert_media.split(":")[0]
      data:
        media_content_id: !input alert_media.split(":")[1]
        media_content_type: "audio/mp3"
  mode: single
  ```

  ---
  **How it works:**
  1. **Trigger:** Detects when the door sensor turns `on`.
  2. **Delay:** Waits the specified duration (`open_duration`).
  3. **Action:** Plays the selected media on the target speaker.

  **Notes:**
  - Ensure the `alert_media` format is `entity_id:media_id` (e.g., `media_player.living_room: "alert.mp3"`).
  - Replace `audio/mp3` with the correct media type if needed (e.g., `audio/mpeg`).
  - Test with a short duration first (e.g., 1 minute) to verify functionality.
