    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** for turning on a light when a door opens, with a 2-minute timeout or manual off when the door closes:

  ---
  **Name:** Door Opens → Light On (2-Min Timeout)
  **Description:** Turns on a light when a door opens, then turns it off after 2 minutes or when the door closes.

  ### **Inputs:**
  | **Input**       | **Type**       | **Description**                                      |
  |-----------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
  | `door_sensor`   | `binary_sensor`| The door sensor that triggers the automation.        |
  | `light_switch`  | `light`        | The light(s) to turn on when the door opens.        |

  ### **Automation Code:**
  ```yaml
  alias: "Door Opens → Light On (2-Min Timeout)"
  description: "Turns on a light when a door opens, then turns it off after 2 minutes or when the door closes."
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
  action:
    - choose:
        - conditions:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: !input door_sensor
              state: "on"
          sequence:
            - service: light.turn_on
              target: !input light_switch
            - delay: "00:00:01"  # Small delay to ensure state is stable
            - delay: "00:02:00"  # 2-minute timeout
            - service: light.turn_off
              target: !input light_switch
      default: []
  mode: restart
  ```

  ### **How It Works:**
  1. **Trigger:** When the door sensor (`door_sensor`) turns `on` (door opens).
  2. **Action:**
     - Turns on the light (`light_switch`).
     - Waits **2 minutes** (or until the door closes).
     - Turns off the light if the door stays open for 2+ minutes.
     - If the door closes before 2 minutes, the light stays off (no extra action needed).

  ### **Notes:**
  - Works with **any binary sensor** (e.g., magnetic door sensor).
  - Supports **multiple lights** (comma-separated in `light_switch`).
  - Adjust the `delay` if you want a shorter/longer timeout.

  **Installation:**
  1. Go to **Settings → Automations & Scenes → Blueprints**.
  2. Click **+ Add Blueprint** → **Create from YAML**.
  3. Paste the code above and save.
  4. Configure the inputs (`door_sensor` and `light_switch`) when creating the automation.
