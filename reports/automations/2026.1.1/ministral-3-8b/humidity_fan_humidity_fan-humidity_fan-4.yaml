    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  Here’s a simple **YAML automation** for your **Humidity Fan** use case. Save this as a custom automation in **Home Assistant**:

  ```yaml
  alias: "Humidity Fan Control"
  description: "Turns on/off a fan based on humidity levels"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input "humidity_sensor"
      to: "*.*"  # Any change in humidity value
  action:
    - choose:
        - conditions:
            - condition: template
              value_template: "{{ state_attr('input_number.humidity_level', 'value') > state_attr('sensor.humidity_sensor', 'value') }}"
          sequence:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: !input "fan_entity"
              state: "off"
            - service: fan.turn_on
              target:
                entity_id: !input "fan_entity"
        - conditions:
            - condition: template
              value_template: "{{ state_attr('input_number.humidity_level', 'value') <= state_attr('sensor.humidity_sensor', 'value') }}"
          sequence:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: !input "fan_entity"
              state: "on"
            - service: fan.turn_off
              target:
                entity_id: !input "fan_entity"
  mode: restart
  ```

  ### **How to Set Up:**
  1. **Create Inputs** (if not already done):
     - Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Automation > Create Automation > YAML**.
     - Add these inputs in the **Inputs** tab:
       - `humidity_sensor` (select your humidity sensor, e.g., `sensor.bathroom_humidity`).
       - `humidity_level` (number input, default `60`).
       - `fan_entity` (select your fan, e.g., `fan.bathroom_fan`).

  2. **Paste the YAML** above and save.

  ### **How It Works:**
  - If humidity **exceeds** the set level, the fan turns **on** (if off).
  - If humidity **drops below** the set level, the fan turns **off** (if on).
  - No redundant actions (won’t turn on/off if already in that state).

  ### **Alternative (Simpler) Version (if you prefer):**
  If you want a **one-way trigger** (only turns on when humidity rises above threshold, but doesn’t turn off automatically), use this instead:

  ```yaml
  alias: "Humidity Fan (One-Way)"
  trigger:
    - platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: !input "humidity_sensor"
      above: !input "humidity_level"
  action:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input "fan_entity"
      state: "off"
    - service: fan.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: !input "fan_entity"
  ```
