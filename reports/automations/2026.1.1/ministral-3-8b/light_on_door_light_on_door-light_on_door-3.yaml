    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.

  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** for turning on a light when a door opens, with a 2-minute timeout or manual off when the door closes:

  ---
  **Name:** Door Opens → Light On (2-Min Timeout)
  **Description:** Turns on a light when a door opens, then turns it off after 2 minutes or when the door closes.

  ### **Inputs:**
  | **Input**          | **Type**       | **Description**                                                                 |
  |--------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `door_sensor`      | `binary_sensor`| The door sensor that triggers the automation (e.g., `binary_sensor.front_door`). |
  | `light_switch`     | `light`        | The light(s) to turn on when the door opens.                                    |

  ---

  ### **Automation Code (YAML Blueprint):**
  ```yaml
  alias: "Door Opens → Light On (2-Min Timeout)"
  description: "Turns on a light when a door opens, then turns it off after 2 minutes or when the door closes."
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
  action:
    - choose:
        - conditions:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: !input door_sensor
              state: "on"
          sequence:
            - service: light.turn_on
              target: !input light_switch
            - delay: "00:00:02"  # Wait 2 minutes
            - service: light.turn_off
              target: !input light_switch
        - conditions:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: !input door_sensor
              state: "off"
          sequence:
            - service: light.turn_off
              target: !input light_switch
  mode: restart
  ```

  ---

  ### **How It Works:**
  1. **Trigger:** When the `door_sensor` turns `on` (door opens), the light turns on.
  2. **Timeout:** After 2 minutes, the light turns off **unless** the door is still open.
  3. **Manual Off:** If the door closes (`door_sensor` turns `off`), the light turns off immediately.

  ---
  ### **Notes:**
  - Replace `!input door_sensor` and `!input light_switch` with your actual entities.
  - Adjust the `delay` (2 minutes) if needed.
  - Works with **single or multiple lights** (e.g., `light.pantry_light, light.hallway_light`).
