    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** for your door-open alert automation:

  ---
  **Name:** Door Left Open Alert
  **Description:** Plays an alert on a speaker when a door is left open for a specified duration.

  **Inputs:**
  | **Input**         | **Type**      | **Description**                                                                 |
  |-------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `door_sensor`     | `entity`      | Binary sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.garage_door_contact`)                     |
  | `alert_media`     | `media`       | Media player (e.g., `media_player.living_room_speaker`) + media ID (e.g., `media_id: 123`) |
  | `open_duration`   | `duration`    | Time (e.g., `00:30:00` for 30 minutes) before triggering the alert.           |

  ---
  **YAML Blueprint:**
  ```yaml
  alias: "Door Left Open Alert"
  description: "Alerts when a door is left open for a specified duration."
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
      for:
        hours: !input open_duration.hours
        minutes: !input open_duration.minutes
        seconds: !input open_duration.seconds
  action:
    - service: media_player.play_media
      target:
        entity_id: !input alert_media.entity_id
      data:
        media_id: !input alert_media.media_id
  mode: single
  ```

  ---
  ### **How to Use:**
  1. **Add the Blueprint** in Home Assistant via **Automations > Blueprints**.
  2. **Configure Inputs**:
     - `door_sensor`: Select your door contact sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.garage_door_contact`).
     - `alert_media`: Choose a speaker (e.g., `media_player.living_room_speaker`) and the media ID (e.g., a custom notification sound).
     - `open_duration`: Set the delay (e.g., `00:30:00` for 30 minutes).
  3. **Save & Activate**.

  ---
  ### **Notes:**
  - The automation triggers **only once** per door-open event (due to `mode: single`).
  - Adjust `open_duration` in the YAML if needed (e.g., `00:05:00` for 5 minutes).
