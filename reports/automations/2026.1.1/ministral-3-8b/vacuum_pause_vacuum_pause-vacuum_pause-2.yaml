    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** for pausing a vacuum when a phone call is detected:

  ---
  **Name:** Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
  **Description:** Pauses a vacuum when a phone call is received.

  **Inputs:**
  | **Name**            | **Type**         | **Description**                          |
  |---------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
  | `phone_call_sensor` | `binary_sensor`  | Binary sensor that triggers on a call.   |
  | `vacuum_entity`     | `vacuum`         | Vacuum to pause when a call starts.      |

  ---
  **Trigger:**
  - **Event:** `binary_sensor.state` changed to `on` (for `phone_call_sensor`)

  **Conditions:**
  - **State:** `vacuum_entity` is `on` (running)

  **Actions:**
  1. **Service:** `vacuum.pause`
     **Target:** `vacuum_entity`
     **Data:** `{}` (no extra options needed)

  ---
  ### Notes:
  - The vacuum will **pause** (not stop) and can be resumed manually.
  - If the call ends while the vacuum is paused, it will **not** auto-resume.
  - Works with any binary sensor (e.g., `phone_call` from **Call Log** or **Google Assistant**).

  ---
  ### Example Setup:
  1. Add the blueprint via **Automation > Blueprints > Add from URL** (or manually create it).
  2. Configure the inputs in the automation editor.
  3. Test by calling a number linked to your `phone_call_sensor`.
