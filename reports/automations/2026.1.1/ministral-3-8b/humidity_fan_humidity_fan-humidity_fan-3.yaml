    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  Here’s a simple **YAML automation** for your humidity-based fan control. This avoids creating a blueprint (which requires more setup) but achieves the same goal:

  ```yaml
  alias: "Humidity Fan Control"
  description: "Turns on/off a fan based on humidity levels"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input "humidity_sensor"
      to: !input "humidity_level"
      for:
        hours: 0
        minutes: 0
        seconds: 10  # Small delay to avoid rapid toggling
  condition: []
  action:
    - if:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: !input "fan_entity"
          state: "off"
      then:
        - service: fan.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: !input "fan_entity"
      else:
        - service: fan.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: !input "fan_entity"
  mode: restart
  ```

  ### How to Use:
  1. **Add to your `automations.yaml`** (or create a new file).
  2. **Configure inputs** in the UI (under *Settings > Devices & Services > Automations > Create Automation > YAML*):
     - `humidity_sensor`: Your humidity sensor (e.g., `sensor.bathroom_humidity`).
     - `humidity_level`: The threshold (e.g., `60`).
     - `fan_entity`: Your fan (e.g., `fan.bathroom_fan`).

  ### Key Features:
  - **Triggers when humidity crosses the threshold** (up or down).
  - **No redundant actions**: Won’t toggle the fan if it’s already in the desired state.
  - **Small delay** to avoid rapid toggling (adjust `seconds` if needed).
