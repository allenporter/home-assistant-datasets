    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** for pausing a vacuum when a phone call is detected:

  ---
  **Name:** Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
  **Description:** Pauses a vacuum when a phone call is detected via a binary sensor.

  ### **Inputs:**
  | **Input**            | **Type**       | **Description**                          |
  |----------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
  | `phone_call_sensor`  | `binary_sensor`| Binary sensor that triggers on a call.   |
  | `vacuum_entity`      | `vacuum`       | The vacuum to pause.                     |

  ### **Automation Code:**
  ```yaml
  alias: "Pause Vacuum on Phone Call"
  description: "Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is detected."
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
      to: "on"
  condition: []
  action:
    - if:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
          state: "cleaning"
      then:
        - service: vacuum.pause
          target:
            entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
      else:
        - delay: "00:00:05"  # Optional: Small delay to avoid rapid triggers
        - service: vacuum.pause
          target:
            entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
  mode: single
  ```

  ### **How It Works:**
  1. **Trigger:** Detects when the `phone_call_sensor` turns `on`.
  2. **Condition:** Checks if the vacuum is actively cleaning.
  3. **Action:** Pauses the vacuum (does not stop it).
  4. **Resume:** The vacuum must be manually resumed (e.g., via the UI or another automation).

  ### **Notes:**
  - Replace `phone_call_sensor` with your actual binary sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.phone_call`).
  - Replace `vacuum_entity` with your vacuum’s entity ID (e.g., `vacuum.living_room`).
  - The vacuum will **not** resume automatically—it must be manually unpaused.

  **Installation:**
  1. Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes > Blueprints**.
  2. Click **+ Create Blueprint** and paste the YAML above.
  3. Configure the inputs and save.
