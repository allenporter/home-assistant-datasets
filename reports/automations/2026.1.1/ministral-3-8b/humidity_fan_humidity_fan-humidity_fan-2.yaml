    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  Here’s a simple **YAML automation** for your humidity-based fan control. Save this as a custom automation in **Home Assistant**:

  ```yaml
  alias: "Humidity Fan Control"
  description: "Turns on/off a fan based on humidity levels"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
      to: !input humidity_level
      for:
        hours: 0
        minutes: 0
        seconds: 10  # Small delay to avoid rapid toggling

  action:
    - choose:
        # If humidity rises above threshold, turn on fan
        - conditions:
            - condition: template
              value_template: "{{ trigger.to_state.state > trigger.from_state.state }}"
          sequence:
            - if:
                condition: state
                entity_id: !input fan_entity
                state: "off"
              then:
                - service: fan.turn_on
                  target:
                    entity_id: !input fan_entity

        # If humidity drops below threshold, turn off fan
        - conditions:
            - condition: template
              value_template: "{{ trigger.to_state.state < trigger.from_state.state }}"
          sequence:
            - if:
                condition: state
                entity_id: !input fan_entity
                state: "on"
              then:
                - service: fan.turn_off
                  target:
                    entity_id: !input fan_entity
  ```

  ### **How to Use:**
  1. **Add as a Custom Automation** in Home Assistant:
     - Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes > Create Automation**.
     - Select **Manual** (or import this YAML).
     - Replace `!input` placeholders with your actual entities (e.g., `sensor.bathroom_humidity`, `number.humidity_threshold`, `fan.bathroom_fan`).

  2. **Inputs Required:**
     - `humidity_sensor` (e.g., `sensor.bathroom_humidity`).
     - `humidity_level` (e.g., `60`).
     - `fan_entity` (e.g., `fan.bathroom_fan`).

  3. **Key Features:**
     - Turns **ON** the fan when humidity rises above the threshold.
     - Turns **OFF** the fan when humidity drops below the threshold.
     - Avoids rapid toggling with a small delay.
     - Won’t double-trigger if the fan is already in the desired state.
