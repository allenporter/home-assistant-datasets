The trigger fires when the specified `door_sensor` changes to the `on` state (open) and stays that way for the duration given in `open_duration`.  \n2. When the trigger fires, the action calls `media_player.play_media` on the selected speaker (`alert_media.media_player`) with the chosen media content type and ID (`alert_media.media_content_type`, `alert_media.media_content_id`).\n\nSimply add this blueprint to Home Assistant, then create an automation from it and set the inputs for the door sensor, the speaker/media, and the desired open‑duration threshold.","door_left_open-test_door_open_plays_media","Bad","AssertionError: Unable to load automation."

However, I can help you set up a manual automation using Home Assistant's built-in automation editor.\n\nHere’s how you can create the automation:\n\n1. Go to **Automations** in Home Assistant.\n2. Click **Create Automation**.\n3. Choose **Use YAML Editor**.\n4. Paste the following YAML configuration:\n\n```yaml\nautomation:\n  - alias: 'Turn on fan when humidity exceeds threshold'\n    description: 'Turns on the bathroom exhaust fan when humidity exceeds a set level and turns it off when it drops below.'\n    trigger:\n      - platform: state\n        entity_id: sensor.bathroom_humidity\n        to: 'above'\n        for:\n          minutes: 1\n    condition:\n      - condition: state\n        entity_id: fan.bathroom_exhaust_fan\n        state: 'off'\n    action:\n      - service: fan.turn_on\n        target:\n          entity_id: fan.bathroom_exhaust_fan\n    mode: single\n\n  - alias: 'Turn off fan when humidity drops below threshold'\n    description: 'Turns off the fan when humidity drops below the set level.'\n    trigger:\n      - platform: state\n        entity_id: sensor.bathroom_humidity\n        from: 'above'\n        to: 'below'\n    condition:\n      - condition: state\n        entity_id: fan.bathroom_exhaust_fan\n        state: 'on'\n    action:\n      - service: fan.turn_off\n        target:\n          entity_id: fan.bathroom_exhaust_fan\n    mode: single\n```\n\n> 🔧 **Note**: Replace `sensor.bathroom_humidity` with the actual entity ID of your humidity sensor (e.g., `sensor.bathroom_exhaust_fan_humidity`), and `fan.bathroom_exhaust_fan` with your fan's entity ID.\n\n5. Save and enable the automation.\n\n### To use it with inputs:\n- Use **Input Number** for `humidity_level` (e.g., `input_number.bathroom_humidity_threshold`).\n- Use **Input Entity** for `humidity_sensor` and `fan_entity` if you want to make it configurable.\n\nLet me know if you’d like help creating those input entities.","humidity_fan-test_fan_triggered_off","Bad","AssertionError: Unable to load automation."

Click **Create Automation**.\n3. Use the **Visual Editor** or **YAML Editor**.\n\n### YAML Example:\n```yaml\nautomation:\n  alias: 'Turn on light when door opens'\n  trigger:\n    - platform: state\n      entity_id: binary_sensor.pantry_door\n      to: 'on'\n  action:\n    - service: light.turn_on\n      target:\n        entity_id: light.pantry_light\n    - delay: '00:02:00'\n    - service: light.turn_off\n      target:\n        entity_id: light.pantry_light\n  mode: single\n```\n\n### Steps:\n- Replace `binary_sensor.pantry_door` with your actual door sensor entity.\n- Replace `light.pantry_light` with your actual light entity.\n\nThis will:\n- Turn on the light when the door opens.\n- Turn it off after 2 minutes, or immediately when the door closes (if you add a second trigger).\n\nWould you like me to help you create a more advanced version with a close trigger?","light_on_door-test_light_timeout","Bad","AssertionError: Unable to load automation."
