Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes > Create Automation**.\n2. Select **'Use a blueprint'** and search for this one.\n3. Configure:\n   - **Humidity Sensor** (e.g., `sensor.bathroom_humidity`).\n   - **Humidity Threshold** (e.g., `60`).\n   - **Fan Entity** (e.g., `fan.bathroom_exhaust`).\n\n### Key Features:\n- Only turns the fan **on if it’s off** and **off if it’s on**.\n- Uses `restart` mode to avoid duplicate triggers.\n- Works for both rising and falling humidity.","humidity_fan-test_fan_triggered_off","Bad","AssertionError: Unable to load automation."
