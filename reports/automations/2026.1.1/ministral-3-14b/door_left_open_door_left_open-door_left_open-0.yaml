    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here’s a **YAML blueprint** for your Home Assistant automation to alert when a door is left open:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Door Left Open Alert
    description: >
      Plays an alert on a speaker when a door is left open for a specified duration.
    domain: automation
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: Door Sensor
        description: The door sensor to monitor.
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
            device_class: door
      alert_media:
        name: Alert Media
        description: The media player and sound to play when the door is left open.
        selector:
          media:
      open_duration:
        name: Open Duration
        description: How long the door must stay open before triggering the alert.
        selector:
          duration:

    source_url: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/door-left-open-alert-blueprint/123456
  ```

  ### **Automation YAML (for use in Home Assistant)**
  To use this blueprint, create an automation with this YAML (adjust inputs as needed):

  ```yaml
  alias: "Door Left Open Alert"
  description: "Alerts when a door is left open for too long"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"
  action:
    - delay: !input open_duration
    - if:
        condition: state
        entity_id: !input door_sensor
        state: "on"
      then:
        - service: media_player.play_media
          target: !input alert_media
          data:
            media_content_type: "sound"
            media_content_id: !input alert_media
  ```

  ### **How It Works**
  1. **Trigger:** Monitors the door sensor for an open state.
  2. **Delay:** Waits for the specified duration (`open_duration`).
  3. **Check:** If the door is still open after the delay, it plays the alert on the selected media player.

  ### **Example Use Case (Garage Door)**
  ```yaml
  alias: "Garage Door Left Open Alert"
  description: "Alerts if garage door is open for >30 minutes"
  use_blueprint:
    path: your_blueprint_path.yaml  # Replace with actual path
    input:
      door_sensor: binary_sensor.garage_door
      alert_media: media_player.living_room
      open_duration: "00:30:00"
  ```

  ### **Notes**
  - Replace `your_blueprint_path.yaml` with the actual path where you save the blueprint.
  - Ensure the `door_sensor` is a **binary_sensor** with `device_class: door`.
  - The `alert_media` should be a **media player** with a valid sound file (e.g., `media_content_id: /local/alert.mp3`).
