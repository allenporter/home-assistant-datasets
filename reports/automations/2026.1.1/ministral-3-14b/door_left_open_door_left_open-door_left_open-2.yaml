    # Door left open

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to play an alert on the speaker when the door is
    left open.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Play an message on the living room speaker if the garage door has been left open for more than 30 minutes
    - When the front door is ajar for 5 minutes, play a sound on the kitchen bluetooth speaker.

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input           | Selector Type | Description                                                                           |
    | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`   | `entity`      | A `binary_sensor` entity selector door sensor that is the target of the automation.   |
    | `alert_media`   | `media`       | The target for the `media` selector for the media player and media id with the alter. |
    | `open_duration` | `duration`    | A `duration` selector, the amount of time before playing the alert.                   |

    The automation should play the selected media when the door has been open for the specified duration.

  Here’s a **YAML blueprint** for your Home Assistant automation to alert when a door is left open:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Door Left Open Alert
    description: >
      Plays an alert on a speaker when a door has been left open for a specified duration.
    domain: automation
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: Door Sensor
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
            device_class: door
      alert_media:
        name: Alert Media
        selector:
          media:
      open_duration:
        name: Open Duration
        description: Time before alert triggers
        selector:
          duration:

  mode: single
  max_exceeded: silent

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"

  action:
    - delay: !input open_duration
    - if:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: !input door_sensor
          state: "on"
      then:
        - service: media_player.play_media
          target: !input alert_media
          data:
            media_content_id: !input alert_media
            media_content_type: "music"
  ```

  ### How to Use:
  1. **Install the Blueprint** in Home Assistant via the UI (Automations → Blueprints → "+ Import Blueprint").
  2. **Create a New Automation** and select this blueprint.
  3. **Configure Inputs**:
     - `door_sensor`: Select the door sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.front_door`).
     - `alert_media`: Choose a media player (e.g., `media_player.living_room_speaker`) and the alert sound (e.g., a TTS message or a sound file).
     - `open_duration`: Set how long the door must stay open before triggering (e.g., `00:30:00` for 30 minutes).

  ### Notes:
  - The automation **stops** if the door closes before the duration elapses.
  - For **TTS alerts**, use `media_content_type: "text"` and provide a TTS message in `media_content_id`.
  - Test with a short duration first (e.g., 1 minute) to ensure it works.
