    # Humidity Fan

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to turn on the fan based on the value of the humidity sensor.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the bathroom exhaust fan when the bathroom humidty is above 60%
    - Make sure the garage does not get too humid

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `humidity_sensor` | A `sensor` entity that is a humidty sensor that triggers the automation. |
    | `humidity_level` | A `number` selector to set the value used as the trigger. |
    | `fan_entity`     | A `fan` entity to turn on when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the `humidity_sensor` level goes above `humidity_level`. When
    triggered, the fan should be turned off. The fan should also be stopped when the
    sensor goes back down below the desired level. The automation should not try to
    turn the fan on if it is already on, and should not turn the fan off when it is
    already off.

  Here’s a simple **YAML blueprint** for your humidity-controlled fan automation in Home Assistant:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Humidity-Controlled Fan
    description: Turns on a fan when humidity exceeds a set threshold and turns it off when humidity drops below the threshold.
    domain: automation
    input:
      humidity_sensor:
        name: Humidity Sensor
        description: Select a humidity sensor to monitor.
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: sensor
            device_class: humidity
      humidity_level:
        name: Humidity Threshold (%)
        description: Humidity level at which the fan turns on.
        selector:
          number:
            min: 0
            max: 100
            step: 1
            mode: slider
      fan_entity:
        name: Fan Entity
        description: Select the fan to control.
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: fan

  mode: restart
  max_exceeded: silent

  trigger:
    - platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
      above: !input humidity_level
    - platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
      below: !input humidity_level

  action:
    - choose:
        - conditions:
            - condition: trigger
              platform: numeric_state
              entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
              above: !input humidity_level
          sequence:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: !input fan_entity
              state: "off"
            - service: fan.turn_on
              target:
                entity_id: !input fan_entity
        - conditions:
            - condition: trigger
              platform: numeric_state
              entity_id: !input humidity_sensor
              below: !input humidity_level
          sequence:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: !input fan_entity
              state: "on"
            - service: fan.turn_off
              target:
                entity_id: !input fan_entity
  ```

  ### How to Use:
  1. Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes > Create Automation**.
  2. Select **"Use a blueprint"** and search for this one.
  3. Configure:
     - **Humidity Sensor** (e.g., `sensor.bathroom_humidity`).
     - **Humidity Threshold** (e.g., `60`).
     - **Fan Entity** (e.g., `fan.bathroom_exhaust`).

  ### Key Features:
  - Only turns the fan **on if it’s off** and **off if it’s on**.
  - Uses `restart` mode to avoid duplicate triggers.
  - Works for both rising and falling humidity.
