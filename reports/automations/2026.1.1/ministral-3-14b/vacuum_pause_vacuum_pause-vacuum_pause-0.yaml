    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** automation to pause your vacuum when a phone call is received:

  ### **Blueprint YAML**
  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
    description: Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is detected.
    domain: automation
    input:
      phone_call_sensor:
        name: Phone Call Sensor
        description: Binary sensor that triggers on incoming calls
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
            device_class: phone
      vacuum_entity:
        name: Vacuum Entity
        description: Vacuum to pause
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: vacuum

  mode: single
  max_exceeded: silent

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
      to: "on"

  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
      state: "cleaning"

  action:
    - service: vacuum.pause
      target:
        entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
  ```

  ### **How It Works**
  1. **Trigger:** Fires when the `phone_call_sensor` turns `on` (call detected).
  2. **Condition:** Only runs if the vacuum is actively cleaning.
  3. **Action:** Pauses the vacuum (resume manually later).

  ### **Setup Steps**
  1. **Create a Binary Sensor for Calls** (if not using a built-in one):
     - Use the **Call Sensor** integration (e.g., via [Call Sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/call_sensor/)).
     - Or use a **Template Binary Sensor** with `state: "ringing"` from a phone integration.

  2. **Add the Blueprint:**
     - Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes > Blueprints**.
     - Click **Add Blueprint** and paste the YAML above.
     - Use the UI to configure `phone_call_sensor` and `vacuum_entity`.

  3. **Test It:**
     - Simulate a call (or make one) and check if the vacuum pauses.

  ### **Notes**
  - The vacuum **resumes only manually** (via app/voice control).
  - If you want auto-resume after the call ends, modify the `action` to include a delay or another trigger.
