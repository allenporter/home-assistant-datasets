    # Vacuum Pause

    ## Problem statement

    Create a blueprint automation to pause the vacuum when I receive a phone call.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Pause the vacuum when I get a phone call from my relatives
    - Don't interrupt my work video convererence call with vacuum noise by pausing it when the call starts

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input               | Description                                                           |
    | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `phone_call_sensor` | A `binary_sensor` entity that triggers when a phone call is received. |
    | `vacuum_entity`     | A `vacuum` entity to pause when the automation fires.                 |

    The automation should trigger when the binary sensor fires and the vacuum is running. The vacuum
    should be paused (not stopped) and can be resumed manually.

  Here’s a simple **Home Assistant Blueprint** automation to pause your vacuum when a phone call is received:

  ### **Blueprint YAML**
  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Pause Vacuum on Phone Call
    description: Pauses the vacuum when a phone call is detected.
    domain: automation
    input:
      phone_call_sensor:
        name: Phone Call Sensor
        description: Binary sensor that triggers on incoming calls
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
      vacuum_entity:
        name: Vacuum Entity
        description: Vacuum to pause
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: vacuum

  mode: single
  max_exceeded: silent

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input phone_call_sensor
      to: "on"

  condition:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
      state: "cleaning"

  action:
    - service: vacuum.pause
      target:
        entity_id: !input vacuum_entity
  ```

  ### **How It Works**
  1. **Trigger:** Fires when the `phone_call_sensor` turns `on`.
  2. **Condition:** Only runs if the vacuum is actively cleaning.
  3. **Action:** Pauses the vacuum (does not stop it).

  ### **How to Use**
  1. Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes > Create Automation**.
  2. Select **"Use a Blueprint"** and search for this one.
  3. Configure:
     - **Phone Call Sensor:** Your call detection sensor (e.g., from a phone app or SIP integration).
     - **Vacuum Entity:** Your vacuum (e.g., Xiaomi, Roborock, etc.).
  4. Save and test.

  ### **Notes**
  - The vacuum will **pause** (not stop) and can be resumed manually.
  - If you want it to **resume automatically** after the call ends, add another trigger for `phone_call_sensor` turning `off` and use `vacuum.resume`.
