    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Here’s a simple **YAML blueprint** for your automation:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: "Light on Door Open"
    description: "Turns on a light when a door opens and turns it off after 2 minutes or when the door closes."
    domain: automation
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: Door Sensor
        description: Binary sensor that detects door open/close
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
            device_class: door
      light_switch:
        name: Light to Control
        description: Light(s) to turn on when door opens
        selector:
          target:
            entity:
              domain: light

  mode: single
  max_exceeded: silent

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"

  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      target: !input light_switch
      data: {}

    - delay: "00:02:00"  # 2-minute timeout

    - choose:
        - conditions:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: !input door_sensor
              state: "off"
          sequence:
            - service: light.turn_off
              target: !input light_switch
        - conditions:
            - condition: state
              entity_id: !input door_sensor
              state: "on"
          sequence: []
  ```

  ### How to Use:
  1. Go to **Settings > Automations & Scenes > Create Automation**.
  2. Select **"Use a blueprint"** and search for this one.
  3. Enter your **door sensor** and **light** entities.

  ### Notes:
  - The light turns **on** when the door opens.
  - The light turns **off** after **2 minutes** if the door is still open **or** immediately if the door closes.
  - Works with **single or multiple lights** (via `target`).
